This is the final submission for the BTech Project (BTP).

1. The pdf BTP-final.pdf is the project report and contains the details of work done, output, results and interpretation.

2. The folder 'code' contains the python programs used.

word-cloud_Gandhi.py : To generate the word clouds for the three periods

skip-gram_Gandhi.py : Implementation of skip-gram model, outputs the word-embedding of 'corruption' for the three historical periods.

3. The programs are running but will require the raw data to produce output. That was too large to send over email.

That's all :)
