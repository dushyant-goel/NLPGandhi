May 29, 1945
MY DEAR C. R.,

Yours written on the train.
I am overwhelmed with work. Hence the delay, if delay it may
be called.
I agree with you about the existence of the evil. My diffculty is
as to the way to deal with it. I want you to depend upon me to do so as
soon as I see the way. Nothing will then stop me. Nor am I unvigilant.
I am glad you liked your stay in Mahabaleshwar.
I hope Papa and Narasimhan came to you at once and that you
are doing well.
I am on your latest pamphlet1 .
Love.

1. I have your letter. I cannot fall in line with Sir Purushottamdas’s opinion. The office should never be in Bombay. However, I do not insist on anything. It is you who have to think over it.
2. It will be very good if some concrete work is taken up. I have
welcomed Devdas’s suggestion. I have also said that he should
demonstrate it in practice. I have already expressed my opinion that
“impatience dose not make a mango tree bear fruit’’ 1 . The work is
new. It is like injecting life into a corpse.
3. The farther the money is kept from the shadow of the
Government, the better. I have no objection if you keep it with some
good firm.
4. I do not want to interfere in small things and also in the
schemes. In fact I should have bothered myself only with the
principles.

BHAI PIR SAHEB,

I have your letter 2 . Perhaps you know that I know the Urdu
script. There is very little difference between Sindhi and Urdu scripts.
You must also be knowing that I call Hindustani that language which
rural Hindus and Muslims of North India speak and which they write
in the Nagari or Urdu scripts. So, if I may advise you, I would suggest
that you teach Hindustani to Hindu and Muslim boys in all the
schools in both the scripts. It is an old thing but did not make much
progress. Now an association has come into being which propagates
this scheme.3

17. INTERVIEW TO DENTON J. BROOKS JR.1
MAHABALESHWAR ,

[On or before May 30, 1945] 2
QUESTION:

Gandhiji, is there any special message you would care to send to the
Negro people of America?
ANSWER: My life is its own message. If it is not, then nothing I
can now write will fulfil the purpose.
When asked to comment on the probable trend of the race relations, Mr.
Gandhi said:

My faith burns brighter today, even brighter than it has in the
1

According to the source, the interviewer, a Negro journalist, was Far Eastern
correspondent of Chicago Defender, in which the interview appeared on June 10,
1945. Brooks reported: “ . . . in the exclusive interview given to me last week . . . at
. . . Morarjee Castle, Mahabaleshwar . . . Gandhiji was observing silence, with the
exception of an hour after evening prayers. . . . I asked questions and he hurriedly
jotted down his answers.”

Brooks reported that “later in the evening” he had attended the “prayers”.
Gandhiji reached Panchgani on May 31, 1945, in the evening.

past; we are fast approaching a solution to roublesome race problems.
This he feels will be accomplished in spite of present-day discouraging
symptoms. And he still feels that the best weapon for use by underprivileged peoples
is non-violence.
Pointing to his recent statement1 made at the beginning of the San Francisco
Conference, he indicated that India’s freedom was closely identified with the welfare
of all other under-privileged peoples. At that time he had said:
The freedom of India will demonstrate to all exploited races of the earth that
their freedom is very near and that in no case will they be exploited.

The Hindu, 15-6-1945

18. DRAFT FOREWORD TO “GITA ANI GITAI”
I have quite a few co-workers who are more or less exclusively
engaged in doing my work and who, therefore, have a claim on me.
However, such a claim should not be made in so many words;
otherwise I would not be able to do the work which I ought to do.
Kundarji asked me to write a Foreword for Gitai ani Gitai and
Gitadhyayasangati. How could I say ‘No’ to him? I agreed and so it
became my duty to read Gitadhyayasangati and Kundarji’s Preface.
This took away one hour of my time. The work will suffer if I let my
hours go thus and the Gita will cease to be my spiritual dictionary.2
The beauty of Gitai is that its meaning and music are rendered 3
in Marathi in such a way that those who do not know the original Gita
can enjoy reading it as they would the original.

Vinoba has been my co-worker ever since the Ashram at
Kochrab1 was set up. He has done plenty of work that I wanted him to
do or that which was dear to me. Take for instance Gitadhyayasangati. I had asked for a little, Vinoba gave me much. The readers
should know that the idea of reciting the Gita in fourteen days and
then in seven days first occurred to me in Yeravda Prison. I told
Vinoba of what I had in mind and asked for his approval and also his
suggestions. In reply he sent me Gitadhyayasangati. By having this
before him the reader who wants to concentrate on the Gita and put its
teaching into practice will2 be benefited.

seems to me very strict. They refuse to give it for five years. I do not
see any harm in having a look at the old yarn. However, it would be
better if we could manage without a loan. This is my personal view.
You can take a loan if the conditions are acceptable to you, if our
workers from Kashmir are also willing and if we cannot give them the
money in any other way. If it becomes necessary to take the loan, I
will give my signature when it is required.

40. LETTER TO RAMASWAMI
May 30, 1945
CHI. RAMASWAMI,

I have not replied to two of your letters. The reason is work.
The postcard does not call for any reply. You must have
received money for the months of April and May. I am sorry that
there was some irregularity in sending the money. I am responsible
for that. When your continuing became uncertain probably I was not
able to make up my mind as to what should be the duty of the
Ashram towards you. I do not remember it well. I am sorry that your
parents were a little hurt.
Only the poor have true and pure ambition. That certainly lifts
them high and throws them into the hands of the demon. This is the
translation of “between the devil and the deep sea”. What you say is
not true. When you feel that you are going to fall into the hands of
Satan, you should give up that work. I don’t think it proper to say
more to you in this connection. You must yourself realize your duty.
Do not blame the zemindar if you want the fame which you can
acquire with your money. Just as among the poor, there are also good
and bad among them. All poor people are not good and all rich
people are not bad. Ponder over the basic things while you are
entering a new life.
I hope there won’t be any difficulty in understanding my
language. You should learn to speak and write in Hindi. Keep on
writing to me. Write to me at Panchgani.

41. FOREWORD TO “VARNAVYAVASTHA”1
I do not have the time to read this book again. I do not even
wish to. I have many other things to do.
In my opinion a man daily moves either forward or backward.
He never stands still. The whole world is moving. There is no
exception to it. I will be making a wrong statement if I say that I am
today what I was yesterday and will remain the same in future. In fact
I should not even have such a desire.
It is right however that my writings and utterances should not be
such as to confuse others. I should not write things which can bear two
interpretations. That is to say I should always have an eye to truth and
non-violence while writing, speaking or doing anything. I can say that
I have been doing that ever since I gave my word to my mother.
In fact I became a devotee of truth ever since I reached the age of
understanding.
This does not mean that I have had or even today have a full
vision of truth and ahimsa. But I do believe that my vision of truth
and ahimsa is becoming clearer every day. Therefore it would not be
correct to say that my views on Varnashrama are the same as they
were in the past. I have said that the varnas and the ashramas are the
gifts of Hinduism to the world, and I still adhere to that view. But
today neither the varnas nor the ashramas of my conception are in
existence anywhere. They should form a part of our religion. But it
can be said that these days the ashramas have disappeared altogether
and varnas are found in the form of privileges. The claim of being a
Brahmin, a Kshatriya, a Vaishya connotes pride. How can there be
pride where there is religion? And the Shudras are not taken into
consideration at all! Shudras are low and the Ati-Shudras are the
lowest of the low. This is not religion but a negation of it.
Where are the four varnas of the Gita today? Varna is entirely
different from caste. There are numerous castes. I know of no
authority for caste in the Gita or any other scripture. The Gita has
prescribed four varnas and they are based on one’s aptitudes and
karma. I am saying four just to give you an example. There can be
more or less varnas than that. But there prevails only one varna today,
1

22

Gandhiji wrote this under the title “Key to My Writings”.

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

that is, of Shudras’, or, you may call it, Ati-Shudras’, or Harijans’ or
untouchables. I have no doubt about the truth of what I say. If I can
bring round the Hindu society to my view, all our internal quarrels
will come to an end. That will also put an end to communal riots
between Hindus and Muslims, and the people of India will occupy a
place of honour in the world. Just as it is not dharma but adharma to
believe in the distinctions of high and low, so also colour prejudice is
adharma. If a scripture is found to sanction distinctions of high and
low, or distinctions of colour, it does not deserve the name of
scripture. One should approach the scriptures with the assumption that
they would not say anything which is contrary to dharma.
Caste distinctions have taken such deep roots that they have
infected the Muslims, Christians and others. It is true that there are
class destinations in more or less degree in all the religions, from
which one has to conclude that that failing is inherent in every human
being. We can cleanse ourselves of that failing only by pure dharma. I
have not found sanction for such distinctions between high and low in
any scriptures. In the eyes of religion all men are equal. An educated,
intelligent and affluent man is no better than an ignorant, stupid and
poor man. If he is cultured, that is to say, if he has been purified by
dharma, he will utilise his education, intelligence and money in the
service of his illiterate, stupid and poor brethren. And he will strive to
give them, that is to say, the whole world, what he has got. If that is
true of religion, then in our present condition, devoid of religion our
dharma lies in becoming Ati-Shudras voluntarily. A man should
consider himself not the owner of his property but its trustee or
custodian. He will use it for the service of society. He will accept only
that much for himself as he has earned with his labour. If that
happens, no one will be poor and no one rich. In such a system all
religions will naturally be held equal. Therefore all quarrels arising
out of religions, caste and economic differences will be ended.
At this stage it is also necessary to ponder over one further
point. It is the foremost dharma of a subject nation to free itself of the
bondage at the very first opportunity. A subject is compulsorily an
Ati-Shudra. It is immaterial whether he has been given titles, or
whether he is made a judge or a peon of a judge or whether he is a
king or a pauper. The more titles one has the more abject is one’s
condition under alien rule. Thus by correlating freedom with dharma
and making the latter widespread, we shall in the natural course of

VOL. 87: 29 MAY, 1945 - 29 AUGUST, 1945

23

things arrive at the state described in the previous paragraph.
A man who wants to follow his dharma will not bother about the
time when this may be realized. If many people do so, it will not only
end our subjection but there will not be any anarchy or confusion in
our freedom. This is the swaraj of my dreams. I yearn for that. I want
to live for the attainment of it. I am devoting every breath of my life
to that effort.
The reader is therefore requested to discard anything in this
book which may appear to him incompatible with my views given
above.
In order to save me labour, a friend who has digested my views
and has done so with great effort, has sent me a brief note of my
present views. Shri Kishorelal thought that I could save time if I could
affix my signature to it. I was free to make any corrections I liked.
But while going through it I found that Shri Kishorelal has, as is his
wont, read through the whole book, has pondered over it and then has
drafted a note as a testimony of my present views. Even if I cannot
sign it, it should be published along with this. There is no
incompatibility between his key and mine. Shri Kishorelal’s note is
based on the study of this book and therefore it would be more
helpful to the readers.
May Truth alone triumph.

May 31, 1945
CHI. MANILAL,

I got your postcard. You did not say where I should address this
reply. When one is constantly moving about, one should indicate the
address either at the top or at the bottom.
Since Sushila has come after so many years, she is naturally very
anxious to meet relations. Maybe, she does not, therefore, bother
about the heat. I feel concerned about the children. I hope they are
not over-strained. I leave for Panchgani this evening. There is bound
to be crowding there. But I have provided for you two, together with
the children. I am planning in my mind to secure one more
bungalow. However, since the breeze has started in Bombay it must be
cooler now. All of you can spend a month in Bombay; the place will
be cool enough.
If possible call on Jairamdas once again.
I didn’t read [the article] about Rajaji carefully. You should
forget it. I don’t feel hurt by anything he does. He is acting according
to his own lights. Everything that appears in newspapers is not true.
You know my views. After all, what matters is one’s actions.

the basis of my writings, so it would perhaps be better if it is
published as it is, under your name. I would, however, know about it

I understand about paricharya. It is like this. I have already
written—haven’t I?—that words like men need growth. As knowledge
grows, the meaning of a word becomes wider, which it should. Why
should we stick to the meanings of the critics? Even then, what you
say seems correct from the point of view of language. The pity is that
I am not a linguist and therefore whatever occurred to me on the spur

May 1945
A correspondent asks me to speak about other village industries
as I do about khadi.
Khadi is the only handicraft which is widespread. Besides, I have
likened it to the sun, and the other industries to the planets.2 The sun is
only one, while the planets are many and new ones are being
discovered.
For the present, it will be enough if you concentrate on
hand-made paper, hand-ground flour, hand-pounded rice, ghanipressed oil, honey from live bees, hide from dead cattle and articles
made from it in villages, village walking-sticks, village-buttons, palm
gur, etc.
As a matter of fact agriculture is a village industry, hence grains,

Nagthat, near Mussoorie, built the Ashok Ashram and started a school and dispensary
in memory of Kasturba Gandhi. He opened the Ashram in July 1942, but was arrested a
month after. Having been released, he was developing it into a training centre for
village industries.

when villages are self-contained, cities will be dependent on them.
As you can see, the tooth-brush belongs to the cities, while
datun belongs to the villages and is better; tooth-powder is of the city
while charcoal powder, chalk or salt are of the village. When you
become village-minded in this way you will find numerous village
articles useful to you.

55. LETTER TO AMRITLAL V. THAKKAR
June 1, 1945
BAPA,

I have your long letter. It does not reveal your anger but your
practical sense. However, the practical sense suggests that you should
not relinquish the post you have accepted. I had often read in South
Africa the letter Gokhale wrote on his return from England expressing
his deep apology.1 One of the sentences in that letter was: “How can I
give up the office under duress when I have not accepted it under
duress?” You are in a similar situation. The only difference is that
there is no pressure at all on you. So it will be sheer cowardice to give
up the post and with that the freely available opportunity of rendering
service. The tongue that calls you a coward only condemns itself.
Moreover, to give up doing service means putting a burden on
Mridula, that is, on the women. Why should you do that? Give it up
when I tell you and if what I tell you appeals to you. The fact is
Mridula does not want to give up anything. I feel that we should leave
only when she has become competent enough to enable us to give up.
In the mean time, we should retain her and encourage her. The words
of mine you quote are the only true words. She should not consider
anything as passed by me unless it has received your independent
approval. However, if she does not do that, you should ignore it but
should do what you want to. About Rs. 2,000 I clearly remember
having told her that she should not consider anything passed as long
as Bapa had not considered and approved it independently. If she has
employed two or three women, I would certainly be in favour of
retaining them. But if you disapprove of it, I will do the same.
I do not feel that you are giving me trouble. Whatever the
trouble may be, it will end. I will see to it.
What remains now is the question about the office. It is in a
large measure in your own hands.
1

In 1897, before the Welby Commission in England, Gokhale made certain
statements, based on letters he received from Poona on the plague operations in that
city, relating to the conduct of British soldiers who were employed to evacuate
compulsorily the infected houses. But when the persons who supplied him with the
information refused to substantiate the allegations, Gokhale had to withdraw and
apologize for the statements which caused indignation in England and in India.

at Panchgani for a month. But, he added, he could do so only if he was allowed to work
undisturbed. Those who wanted to see him should realize that he did not have enough
time even to carry on his day-to-day work which was of all-India importance. He had
been doing this work for 50 years.

This afternoon some young boys had come to see Gandhiji when he could not
oblige them. They asked what was wrong with him. His reply was that he was 76
years old and was not young like them. That did not mean that he was an invalid. He
had strength and that was why he was there for prayers and for Harijan work.

KUMARAMANGALAM
June 2, 1945
Every Congress leader who comes to me tells the same tale (in
regard to the Indian communists). I won’t build judgments on what
they say but the story produces on me an unconscious effect I would
fain avoid. This is thinking aloud, if you please. I agree with L. in so
far as he is concerned (in regard to co-operation with the communists). I disagree so far as I am concerned. For I have no difficulty
in working side by side with communists. One must depend upon
one’s own experiences.

I followed your criticism of the expenditure on four months’
training. As far as I remember, only one person is paid a salary of
Rs. 175. Let it be 110 rather than 72. If you can find a girl, you can
have one. It takes into account all our departments. It seems that you
have not discussed the expenditure with Mridula. I had raised an
objection as regards the training instructor. It is, however, considered
that one instructor will not be able to deal with such a large number.
The idea behind estimating the expenditure liberally is that if the
expenses grow, we shall not have to ask for more. It will perhaps not

different. But let us not worry about it. Whatever goes to the trustees
should be final from our side. It is better if you send your note to

I have a letter from Chi. Purushottam Gandhi. He writes that the
students of the late Vishnu Digambarji have expressed a desire to set
up a music college at Prayag. They want my blessings for that. I have
written to them that you are also his student and I have already given
my blessings to your scheme. Why then should I bless another? He
writes to say that an attempt was made during the lifetime of Pandit
Khare to draw you into their circle but they were unsuccessful.
Chi. Purushottam was a favourite disciple of Pandit Khare. He is
a true devotee of his guru. I have known some of the persons of that
group for a long time but I came in close contact with you only
recently. Please throw some light on this confusion.

76. DISCUSSION WITH SHRIMAN NARAYAN 1
P ANCHGANI,

June 2, 1945
QUESTION:

To my mind one of the greatest problems confronting us at the
present moment is that of combating the systematic plan of economic exploitation
by flooding the market with foreign consumer goods. This is bound to spell disaster
to Indian industrialization whether small-scale or large-scale. And the pity of it is
that our own businessmen and industrialists seem to be vying with one another in
becoming glorified agents of foreign manufacturers. Do you not think that an urgent
need of the hour is the rousing of public conscience against the matter of foreign
goods? I think constructive workers should take up this programme immediately. A
countrywide propaganda for the use of village-manufactured and swadeshi goods can
also prove to be a very elective and economic sanction against foreign domination.
What is your opinion and advice?
ANSWER:

The difficulty cannot be met by carrying on
propaganda, however wide and intensive. The first thing is to
demonstrate its economic fallacy. Let us recognize that the
industrialists are not conscious traitors. They honestly believe that
their plan will bring prosperity to the masses. They are wrong. But
how to show that they are wrong save by patient study and publication
thereof and by working so as to show that the masses respond to the
work and actually prosper?
This demands hard thinking, hard study and harder constructive
work among the masses. They have to manufacture for their own use.

78. DISCUSSION WITH HAREKRUSHNA MEHTAB3
P ANCHGANI,

June 1/3, 1945
QUESTION: Do you think there has been any change in the country to warrant
any change in the Congressmen’s attitude towards the war which they adopted in
1939? If you think there is no change, then has it not come to this that, in your
opinion, Congressmen should not go back to ministries in the present
circumstances?

ANSWER: You ask for my personal opinion. I give it for what it is
worth. Mine can in no sense be an authoritative opinion. You should
examine the Congress attitude not of 1939 but of 1942. So far as I am
aware the Congress offered help in 1942 provided that certain
conditions were fulfilled. It is for the Congress to lay down the
conditions for the present acceptance of office. These must always be
in terms of independence.

The Bombay Chronicle, 4-6-1945, reported that on June 3, C. Rajagopalachari laid the foundation-stone for the memorial building to house a library of the
works of the Tamil poet, Subrahmanya Bharati, at his birth-place, Ettayapuram, in
Tamil Nadu. Gandhiji wrote the message in Tamil.

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

There is no civil disobedience now and you have placed your manifold
constructive programme before the country. Do you approve of the following
definition of the constructive programme—to tackle the immediate problems of the
masses and to try to solve them on non-violent lines as enunciated by you? This
definition includes the work of trying to check black-marketing, profiteering and
also the inflow of foreign consumer goods by insisting upon the use of swadeshi
goods.

You have only a partial grasp of the constructive programme of
my conception. It is comprehensive and all-pervading. Stoppage of
black-marketing, profiteering and foreign consumer goods must
precede construction. They are not part of the programme, but the
programme to be effective and universal has to do that weeding
process. The whole programme is swadeshi.
Would you ask Congressmen to seek co-operation from other parties and even
from Government agencies in the prosecution of the constructive work? How can the
constructive programme be prevented from being used for the purpose of
consolidating the party position for elections and for other purposes?

I have been crying myself hoarse to persuade Congressmen to
adopt whole-heartedly the constructive programme without party
motive or any other. It is its own motive. I seek the co-operation of
the whole nation and also of the Government in carrying out the
programme, naturally, on our own terms.
If the latter give honest co-operation, it must mean
independence without violence and without fuss. If the constructive
programme is worked for electioneering purposes it will carry with it
the seeds of its own disease. Men can prevent vicious people from
using the best things for the worst of purposes.
What should be the attitude of Congressmen towards all those who are now
building up an organization which may come in clash with Congress at some stage or
other in future?

The Congress position should be of complete non-violent
non-co-operation with those who will stab the country in the back.

why prosecution of certain volunteers instead of an inquiry suggested

88. STATEMENT ON SYRIAN-LEBANESE QUESTION1
P ANCHGANI,

[On or after June 3, 1945] 2
I have purposely refrained from saying anything on the Syrian
and Lebanese question, not because I have felt less than others but
because I have felt more. The injustice is so obvious and glaring.
It pains me to think that our Muslim fellow-countrymen
feel that they can effectively ask for justice to the Syrians and
Lebanese as fellow-Muslims. Syrians and the Lebanese are a mixed
population.3 Their liberty is at stake not as Muslims but as a separate
nation. The struggle of Syria and Lebanon for independence
should evoke the sympathy of the whole of India, and it must be
made a national issue, instead of one of a particular section or
community.4 Muslims should speak as Indians and should invite the
cooperation of all India including members of all religions. For
instance the voice of Indian Christians speaking as Christians as apart
from other Indians in international affairs must fall flat. This is the
lesson of history everywhere, but in India, to my mind, the Khilafat
issue emphasizes the lesson which we seem to have forgotten.
The Muslims headed by the late Hakim Saheb sought the
co-operation of all India and the Khilafat question became a plank in
the National Congress. And it drew world attention. Had the history of
victorious Turkey been written differently, India would have taken an
effective part in the settlement of the Khilafat question. India divided
against itself will have no effect on the council of the nations of the
world.
The Bombay Chronicle, 8-6-1945; also The Hindu, 8-6-1945
1

The nationalist movement in Syria and Lebanon had come into violent
conflict with France which had been ruling the area under a mandate since 1923.
France had called for negotiations and at the same time despatched two contingents of
troops. There were widespread clashes culminating in the French bombardment of
Damascus on May 29 and 30. The statement was made in an “exclusive interview to
the special representative of the Orient Press” of India.
2
From the expression “our Muslim fellow-countrymen feel”, presumably a
reference to M. A. Jinnah’s statement of June 3, which assured Syrians and Lebanese
of the support of “the hundred million Muslims of India”. Jinnah had also warned that
“not only the Middle East and Muslim India but also the whole of the Muslim world
will flare up” if freedom was not granted.

DEAR FRIENDS,

Gandhiji has your cable.
He appreciates your desire to have him in America.1 But you have seen how he
could not come. He could not force himself on the Committee. He has not much faith
in the value of more verbal talks. He is trying to forge the message of non-violence
through his work in India. If he shows visible success here the world will get the
message it needs. Therefore the conscientious objectors who are going to meet near
Glendora would do well to closely study what he has been saying and doing in India.
Particularly, they should study his writings preceding and after the 8th August,
1942—Resolution of the Congress. They reflect the working of a non-violent mind
in the face of the greatest crisis in the world’s history.

grandmother has passed away. She has settled her accounts, but
suffered much while doing so. The fact that she exacted service from
you both earned you merit. But wasn’t that at her cost? One should
not wish to earn such merit. I, therefore, regard grandmother’s
passing away a very good thing indeed from every point of view.

CHI. KRISHNACHANDRA,

Those who create the political system have not come from
outside; it is we ourselves. The meaning of your difficulty is that the
political power should pass into our hands. But a non-violent political
system can come about only through non-violent means. Hence
whether we are one or many we should engage ourselves only in
non-violent activities. One can become many, zero cannot.
My impression about the discharge was correct. I may have
written1 the opposite in my hurry. Anyway do not worry. It applies
equally to both.

P ANCHGANI,

June 4, 1945
BHAI PROFULLA,

The Working Committee of the Kasturba Memorial Trust met at
Mahabaleshwar. Your objection to keeping the entire fund with the
Head Office was put up to it. I had told you that I would write to you
and clarify the whole thing. You know that the fund raised in Bombay
is kept in the Head Office. I feel that the same should be done with the
money raised in Calcutta. The committee which is formed now is to
consider how the money will be spent in the villages. Why should we
argue over where the money should be kept? Your duty is to submit a
scheme and if it is accepted, to get it implemented. You must be
knowing that the committee for collecting the money and the
committee for spending it are not the same. It is true that the same
three persons are on most of the committees. But that is our
misfortune. There are very few workers and those who give the money
claim the right to have a control over the spending of it. When they
are deserving, it may become our duty to have the donors on the
committees. What more can I write? I would suggest that you
explainmy view to the committee and write a satisfactory letter.

will have fully understood my advice and acted in strict accordance
with it. Man is not a lifeless machine, though he should work like a
machine; he is a conscious being and while working as a machine he
should work with faith and intelligence, that is to say, with his heart
and his mind. Only then will he shine and succeed in hs effort. I have
read your statement. Now ease your mind of the burden. Do what you
can and give what help and guidance you can while resting. If you do
only that much, though you have ceased to be Secretary, the
management will remain in your hands, for your experience and
patience are your own and cannot be transferred to anybody. Those
who wish may take them from you. Even if they do there will be no
diminution of your possession. This is the meaning of the verse

I have already written to you that I have been working on your
letter. I am sending you a copy of the letter Bhulabhai has written.
The argument he has given is the one supported by all the eminent
lawyers the world over. I can testify to it. I can understand why
Bhulabhai has accepted this case. He has plenty of money. We may be
sure he has not accepted the case for the sake of the money. He has
accepted the case as a lawyer and has kept politics out of it. We should
be proud of it and we should pray that truth alone may triumph and if
Khuhro 1 is guilty he may be proved so. This does not happen in the
courts of today. We often find the guilty being acquitted. But we
should not give up hope on that account.2
I hope your health is good. Write to me what new activity
Kripalani is starting. Jairamdas along with Devibehn and Premi should
be coming here today

115. LETTER TO BHULABHAI DESAI
June 7, 1945
BHAI BHULABHAI,

I have sat down to write this letter after the morning prayer,
i. e., at about 6 o’clock. I saw your letter last evening.
I am writing this with the sole desire that you should retain the
eminent position you occupy. I hesitate to write because I write
without any official authority. There is a very big difference between
yourlegal style and my own old-fashioned one or rather between your
legal knowledge and mine. I am saying this deliberately and not
through false modesty. I learnt while studying law and practising it—
and I have always acted upon the understanding—that a lawyer,
having accepted the brief of an untruthful case should give it up as
soon as he realizes its untruthfulness, that is, ask for a verdict against
his client. I know that there is a section of the bar which holds the
opposite view. They ask what the function of the judge would be if an
advocate himself were to sit in judgment on his case. I have always
held, and hold even today, that that section is mistaken. This is my
own view. I find the whole of your argument unconvincing. It should
be of no concern either to you or to me whether it is the question of
League or the non-League Muslims. If the case of those who hold
opposite views from ours is just, I would come forward to support it
notwithstanding opposition from everybody else, but if a case is unjust
I would not support it even if it were my own son’s. I also believe that
Bhai Khuhro’s brief should not be rejected merely on the ground that
he is believed to be inciting the Hurs. But, if after having accepted his
brief and studied it, I felt that he was guilty, my moral sense would
teach me that, if permitted by the client, I should plead guilty and take
the punishment. But if he should not permit me, I would request him
to release me and engage another lawyer. I remember having done
that for two Muslim clients. In one case I asked for a verdict against
the client and in another admitted the client’s guilts and got his
punishment much reduced and ultimately had him released after he
had undergone some years of imprisonment. I therefore do not
hesitate to request you that if, after examining the papers of Khuhro’s
case, you feel that he is innocent, you should fight for him, but if you
feel that he is guilty, you should advise him to plead guilty or ask him
to relieve you. This is but a suggestion from me. If, after weighing it
carefully you do not approve of it, reject it. Do not look to the person

66

who has given advice; only think over the advice.
As desired by you, I am sending your letter to Choithram. I feel
that he should have written to you. I also believe that he should not
have formed prejudiced views. But that is a characteristic not only of
our life but of that of the whole world. We have observed that even the
most balanced men have not been able to shed this weakness. Hence,
do not pay attention to Choithram’s shortcomings. If you find any
substance in his otherwise faulty reasoning, accept it. I have not
explained to Choithram the argument I have put before you. I

survive. The steps you have taken will be in vain. You yourself will not
be able to swallow this draught and, even if you do, you will not be
able to persuade the princely States to swallow it. So it is better if you
do not involve me in this business. Seek Khersaheb’s advice and do
whatever he says. I see the point of Dr. Jayakar’s advice. He has given
sincere advice as a lawyer. But I do not see my place in any of this. I

I had a telegram from Chi. Hoshiari and then, yesterday, your
letter came. My advice to Hoshiari’s father is that he should not try to
take her away till I come and since he has arrived in the Ashram he
should await my return and share the work in the Ashram, so that he
will learn something, gain some experience and at the same time not
be a burden on the Ashram. Hoshiari is as dear to me as she is to her
father. If Hoshiari had felt dissatisfied I would not have said
anything.But she is quite happy there, is getting education and
making progress. The Ashram is not perfect, but it is not a bad place.
It has not done any harm to anyone. Many have risen by living in the
Ashram. Those who are good have never felt inconvenienced in the
Ashram. Hoshiari’s father should therefore rest assured that Hoshiari
will not be harmed by living in the Ashram. The rest when I come.
Today I can but request Hoshiari’s father that if he cannot stay on
there for a month, he should not take away Hoshiari with him. If even
in spite of my letters it is decided that Hoshiari should go she should
not go with her father but you should accompany her. I hope the
affairs at the Ashram are going on well. We shall talk about the
servants when we meet.

DEAR FRIEND,

I had your letter of 25th July, 1944. Perhaps you are right that
after this lapse of time it would not be very profitable to enter into a
detailed discussion of the various points raised by your speech in the
House of Lords.
There is one point in your letter however which challenges a
reply. You have adduced two passages from my writings in support of
your remarks in the House of Lords that “When Mr. Gandhi called
upon the British Government to quit India, he said it would be for the
Congress to take delivery.” This, you have argued, connotes totalitarian spirit in the Congress.
I have seen the full text of the Harijan articles referred to in
your letter. Copies of these are enclosed for easy reference.
The passages cited by you are from the Harijan of June 15,
1940, and December 3, 1938, respectively. You will not fail to observe
that they have no relevancy to the point at issue. The Congress
decision in connection with its “Quit India” demand inAugust 1942

is embodied in the official declaration of its President, Maulana Abul
Kalam Azad to which I have referred in my last letter1 to you. To that
decision the Congress still stands committed and one fails to see what
bearing my writings in Harijan have upon it.
The fact however is that the quotations given by you are
incapable of bearing the totalitarian interpretation you have put upon
them. The British Government have often declared that they would
gladly part with power if there was a body in India ready and fit to
take charge. What is wrong in the Congress trying to qualify itself for
that onerous duty? That it does not want power for itself but for the
whole people of India is made absolutely clear by me in the course of
the same article from which you have quoted. Here is the relevant
extract:
Its non-violence forbids the Congress from standing aloof and riding
the high horse as the opponents say. On the contrary it has to woo all parties,
disarm suspicion and create trust in its bona fides.

Is it not the normal goal of every party in a democratic State to
aspire to convert the whole country to its view and to become its
mouthpiece? Does not the party in power in the House of Commons
take delivery of the machinery of administration from the outgoing
party—its predecessor? And is not the formation of coalition cabinets
under the party system of government an exception rather than the
rule? Then how can the refusal of the Congress to sacrifice or water
down its ideal for the sake of securing unanimity with other parties be
called totalitarian?
With regard to the second passage from the article on the
Princes it is only necessary to point out that it was the British
Government itself that called upon the Congress to secure an
agreement with the States, at the Second Round Table Conference.
There could therefore be nothing wrong in its inviting the Princes to
treat with it.
The essential fact to remember in this connection is that the
Congress has no other sanction except that of persuasion and
self-suffering, any other being precluded by its creed. On the other
hand, is not violence, euphemistically called physical force, the basis
and backbone of the totalitarian spirit? If it is, and if you believe in

MY DEAR BHARATAN,

Of course I am going through your book, but I am crawling like

I edited Harijan in English as a matter of cruel necessity. I
should even repeat the performance. But I know that my imperfect
Hindustani would be much better understood, and would reach larger
number of readers. There is force however in what you say. But I
must not devote time to arguing.

The addressee’s reply dated July 2, inter alia, read : “I am still not convinced
. . . . C ngress, you said, would ‘take delivery’; and you urge that that is to be
regarded as justifiable because Congress sincerely wishes to embrace all parties and is
trying to do so. Yes, but while the taking of delivery is to be immediate and certain
the other is still in the future and, it cannot be denied, is problematical.”

I was happy to read your letter. Dr. Krishnavarma is an obliging

anywhere else. So far as I know, he is there not to fleece the patients.
He loves giving this kind of treatment. In any case he doesn’t wish to
charge anything in your case. I have pressed him to accept the
expenditure he will be incurring on your account. I am glad that
Manilal showed interest in your case. I am glad also that Manilal has
taken the key from you and you have given it. I have told him that he
has to pay all the expenses that may be incurred whether from your
account or some other account. You need not worry at all. Do what
Dr. Krishnavarma says. He is competent and I have full faith in him as
regards your treatment. Remember that you had tried to commit
suicide. God saved you. Now make up your mind that you will stay
there and get well.

Do not keep him if he does not observe all the rules. In this way we

were keen on going to Simla. Sumi is being looked after quite well.
Therefore there is no meaning in your going there. Devdas’s
invitation [to go to Delhi] shows his love for you. True love lies in not
submitting at all to such love. This increases mutual love. From time
to time keep advising [Sumi] not to keep awake at the cost of her
eyes. Usha may write whenever she feels like it. It is yours and
Ramdas’s duty to improve in health. Kanam is well. He does not
givetrouble to anyone. He talks a lot. I have shown him the [three]

DEAR KIKIBEHN1 ,

Pyarelalji has received your letter. Your English statements raise
a big question in my mind. When you cannot yourself write in
English, what is the point of getting them written and then signing
them? At the most do as Ba did. She narrated her anguish over
Harilal’s behaviour to Devdas who translated it into English and gave
it to the newspapers saying that it was almost a literal translation of
what Ba had narrated to him. You must have seen it. Such writings will
carry greater weight and with that the mother tongue will also gain in
importance. I will go to the extent of saying that whatever ideas occur
to you, express them as they are either in Sindhi or Hindi. Ultimately
whatever is translated into English is as useless as fruit ripened
artificially.
I am all right.

I have your second letter. You are needlessly unhappy over

is that for one like you there is more work outside. But what of it?
You are capable of doing it. Do not worry at all. Come here, if getting
permission to meet Jayaprakash is going to take time. Go from here
when you have the permission.
About Father, I fervently hope that he may be relieved from the
present crippled state.
My health is of course good. I will go down from here by the
end of the month. If the spectacles suit you, then never give them up.
I keep on receiving letters saying “Prabhavati and Rajkumari must
have reached there”. But neither of you is here. Rajkumari has not
received the order from the Government. She saw from the newspapers that the restriction imposed on her had been lifted. Even on
receiving the intimation from the Government, she will not be able to
come here soon as she must stay in Simla to help her brother and
sister-in-law with their work. It seems she will be able to come only in
July. 1

I wish that too many Indians should stand for election. This is going
to be an important election. It does not matter if he is defeated. If,
moreover, I give in this case the same opinion that I did in Patel’s, it
might be interpreted to mean that I am refusing to support him
because he is a communist. I have no such thought in my mind. The

You must have seen Chi. Narandas’s appeal. If I can find a copy

Labour is the basis of the bank here. It can be a great thing if it can be
done. In my opinion we should fully take part in it. And our part will
consist only in accepting contributions. We shall not give anything.
That is to say that we shall take the yarn from persons offering at least
one hank of it for Narandas’s sutrayajna and give a receipt for it.
Then we have to send an account of it to Narandas every week or
every month. This does not involve much work on our part and it can
bring in quite a lot. This would enhance the importance of this yajna.

you. I hope you will regain your health. I cannot advise you to come

It is good that you wrote to me. I was under the impression that

It is good. You must be knowing my views. I am trying to run away
from the Sammelan. From my own point of view I have broadened
the definition of the national language. I had sown the seed when
I presided2 at the Sammelan for the first time. Under the circumstances it is best for me to keep silent because you are one ofthe

I enclose herewith a letter3 I have written to Ramnath. Send it to

the office. It will be good if you get accommodation in the buildings
of Rashtrabhasha Prachar Sabha or Bajajwadi or Maganwadi. According to Bapa, Bajajwadi or Maganwadi will perhaps be the most

165. NEED FOR KHADI EDUCATION
P ANCHGANI,

June 10, 1945
Soon after the khadi activity was started, the need began to be
felt for the workers to have a scientific knowledge of all the processes
of khadi production. Therefore, as early as 1927-’28 a school was
opened in the Sabarmati Ashram to teach spinning and weaving. As
the khadi activity grew and it became necessary to pay attention to
other aspects such as making khadi attractive to look at and lowpriced, the lack of scientific knowledge of the subject began to be felt
more and more every day. A few workers were able, through their
own individual efforts and experience, to gather many useful bits of
knowledge. The tools were experimented on and improved. All the
lovers of khadi know that the late Shri Maganlal Gandhi worked very
hard in this connection. It then became clear that it was very necessary
for every khadi worker to learn the science of khadi. I have from the
very beginning emphasized this. I prepared a questionnaire about the
various things khadi workers ought to know. In 1937, I also wrote
three articles for the Harijan. In an article dated February 13, 1937, I
wrote :1
In my opinion it should be made obligatory on every khadi worker engaged in
any of the production centres of the A. I. S. A. to know the elements of this science.

Following this policy, khadi schools were later opened. A khadi
1

Vide “What Khadi workers should know”, 13-2-1937.

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

school was opened by the Central Office [of the A. I. S. A.]. The
syllabi for the “spinning workers”, “weaving workers” and “Khadi
Prathama” were prepared and arrangements were made to impart
instruction according to them. It was also hoped then that all the
workers of the Charkha Sangh would join these schools by turns,and
complete their training. In order to save workers from any kind of
difficulties, it was arranged to pay them, over and above their regular
salaries, travelling allowance and other allowances since it was thought
that the workers would have to spend more on food in an unfamiliar
place. One regrets however that the workers have not shown any
increased enthusiasm for learning the khadi science.
Now that the Charkha Sangh has taken up the new work it
becomes obligatory on the part of khadi workers to train themselves
in khadi science. Without that it will be impossible to carry on the new
khadi programme.
According to the new programme, the sales depots too will
almost be like production centres. Not only that; after some time we
intend to convert all khadi production centres and sales depots into
khadi education centres. It will then be unnecessary to send workers to
the schools for khadi training. We have to train in the science of khadi
all the workers, new as well as old.
Those in charge of the branches are therefore requested to
scrutinize the list of workers to assess what training a particular worker
needs and to make arrangements for such training to be given. Lists
of workers should in this way be made and forwarded to the Central
Office. In order to make the training obligatory, we should make the
rise in salary dependent on the degree of khadi education possessed
by the worker. We should also accept the principle that the khadi
worker has to pass an examination. Those who fail should not be
considered qualified. So long as we do not seriously take up the
question of khadi education, how can we hope to succeed?
I have said that if we are true khadi workers, we should have as
much awareness, as much knowledge and as much alertness as is
considered necessary for a member of the I. C. S.

BHAI HAMID KHAN,

I have your letter. I knew Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi2 well. I had
great regard for him. I have already given my view on the question of
a memorial. You must know it. Go through it if you have not already
done so. You can’t raise a memorial by constructing a building or
spending money. A man thinks that having given the money he has
done his duty. Therefore, in my opinion, it will be a true memorial to
Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi if, at least in Kanpur, and as far as possible
throughout India, Hindus and Muslims should unite and instead of
cutting each other’s throats be prepared to lay down their lives for
each other. If this comes about, let me know and then ask for my
blessings. What is there in merely collecting money? Let me also
know who are on the Committee? And what are the grounds for
believing that what has not been achieved so far will be achieved now?
I have seen the aim of the Memorial Committee. That will not
make the memory of the deceased immortal, only bring ridicule to it.
Two or three rich men can jointly put up such buildings, give jobs to a
few persons and thus deceive themselves and others that they
haveraised a memorial to Vidyarthiji. But I will regard it as a
mockery.

169. SPEECH TO RASHTRA SEVA DAL MEMBERS,
PANCHGANI 1
June 10, 1945
Gandhiji congratulated the volunteers for having walked down to Panchgani
from Wai in spite of the rain. He was sorry he could not invite them all to theprayer
hall. The hall belonged to a school. That they allowed him, a rebel, to hold a prayer
meeting in their hall was the essence of the prayer. He knew that the volunteers did
1
According to the A. P. I. report, this is “the authorized version” of Gandhiji’s
speech to about 300 volunteers at a function organized by Dr. B. D. Savant in Parsi
Girls High School. Gandhiji spoke in Hindustani which was rendered into Marathi.

VOL. 87 : 29 MAY, 1945 - 29 AUGUST, 1945

97

not all pray. He had been in close touch with volunteer organizations in India ever
since 1919. Yet he had not been able to make them prayer-minded. He had failed to
create in them an enthusiasm for prayer.
Again he had explained to them right from the beginning that a volunteer must
always serve the people and serve them only through truth and non-violence. Yet
there were very few men and women amongst them who had accepted truth and
non-violence as their creed. He was convinced that real swaraj, that is, swaraj for the
rich and the poor alike, could not be won except through truth and non-violence.
They had just seen the end of a terrible war. It had made people doubt if truth
really counted in this world. The Allies had won, but their victory had been the result
of superior arms and superior man-power. He could not enthuse over it as a victory of
truth over falsehood. At the same time he wanted to make it clear to them that a
victory for the Axis would have been far worse. The Axis had accepted violence as
their creed. The Allies had not done so. They at least paid lip service to peace and
freedom, and truth and non-violence. It was true that their actions belied their
profession. A major part of humanity today consisted of oppressed and enslaved
nations. It was his conviction that, if India could win swaraj through truth and
non-violence, she would be able to bring deliverance to all the other oppressed
nations.
Many of the volunteers were not clad in khadi. He had called the
spinning-wheel the symbol of truth and non-violence and therefore also of swaraj.
That was why it had found a place in the national flag. Therefore he exhorted them all
to spin and produce khadi for their own clothes. Thus they would help to combat the
cloth shortage in the country and help the naked poor.
Lastly he asked them all to learn Hindustani. Hindustani was the language that
Hindus and Mussalmans of North India spoke and which was written in Nagari and
Urdu scripts. All those who spoke Hindustani did not know both the scripts. But
those who wished to serve all should make it a point of honour to learn both the
scripts.

170. SILENCE-DAY NOTE TO BHULABHAI DESAI1
June 11, 1945
Considering all that is happening around us, I see danger in this
partnership with the League.
One thing is definite, namely, that until the members of the
Working Committee are freed and can express their opinion, nothing
can be done in the name of the Congress.
It is also definite that if the Chimur-Ashti prisoners and other
such prisoners are hanged, the situation will become impossible.
Unless the League’s attitude shows a change without any expectation
of gain I will have no deal with it even if the Congress Working
Committee consents. This is for you yourself to think over and
decide. You are in a better position to understand the truth than
anybody else.
The distinction that is being made between the League Muslims
and the others seems to me dangerous from every point of view. I
don’t think it safe to countenance any such position. Think carefully
over what you said last night regarding this.
Will the 40 per cent Congress quota include any representatives
of the Hindu Mahasabha or of Harijans? What about the Sikhs, Parsis,
Christians, etc.? Whether you have discussed this with the League or
not is irrelevant here. When the time for final decision comes, the
Congress will have to consider all these points. The Congress will not
be in the same position as the League. It will have to take into account
all the interests in the country, whereas the League is concerned with
the interests only of the Muslims supporting it. You will have to be
ready to face all these complications. You will definitely not be able to
bring the ship to port by disregarding the parties other than the
League.
Please understand my limitations fully before you proceed
further. As I have explained, my temper is progressively
becomingmore uncompromising. I use the word “uncompromising”
1

“In Mahatma Gandhi—The Last Phase, Vol. I, Book One, p. 120, Pyarelal
explains: “The rejection of the appeal for mercy on behalf of the Ashti-Chimur
prisoners at this stage hardened Gandhiji’s attitude. Extremely sensitive to the
slightest variation in the moral atmosphere around him, he became more and more
insistent on the ‘present tense’. This was very much in evidence when Bhulabhai met
him at Mahabaleshwar.”

in a good sense, so take it in that spirit. Against my indifference to the
Parliamentary scheme and my increasing faith in non-violent
non-co-operation, you can safely place my loyalty to you. It will not
let myself go beyond the limits of what I have given you in writing.
But it is difficult even for me to say where my uncompromising spirit
will take me, for I am coming to put ever increasing faith in the
Unseen Power and, therefore, I think very little about tomorrow.
I started writing this before 6 and it is 6.30 now. I will write
more if anything occurs to me. Otherwise take this as fully
representing my views.

176. TWO POSERS
[On or before June 12, 1945] 1
Shri Sailendra Nath Chattopadhyaya of the United Press puts the
following posers before me: “Why do you wish to live for 125 years,
and what is Ram Rajya?”
The questions are so apt and reasonable that, contrary to my
wont these days, I want to answer them. Many visitors and
correspondents put the same questions. I take this opportunity
therefore and once for all, I hope, of answering them to the best of my
ability.
The idea of 125 years’ life flashed across my mind, while I was
speaking on the 8th August, 1942, to the meeting of the A.I.C.C. in
Bombay. I might have mentioned the same thing before in private
conversation. If I did, I have no recollection. I am a constant student
of the Ishopanishad which contains only eighteen mantras. The first
half of the second mantra means: “Only doing works of service on
this earth, you should wish to live 120 or 125 years.” The word in the
original denoting the number is translated by the word ‘hundred’, but
I had seen just then a com-mentary which took the number to mean
120 or 125. I purposely used the highest figure at the meeting, as
signifying the intense wish to live the longest in order to fulfil my
allotted work. In expressing the wish I only followed my old habit of
wishing to act according to the best of my belief.
Moreover, as a naturopath, I believe in the feasibility of living
the full span of life. I know that, medically speaking, the chances are
against me for I have not always followed nature’s way. I began to
adopt it fairly strictly in South Africa in 1903 or there about. Want of
brahmacharya in early married life must also weigh against the full
span.
My conception of nature cure, like everything else, has
undergone progressive evolution. And for years I have believed that,
if a person is filled with the presence of God and has thus attained the
state of dispassion, he can surmount handicaps against long life. I
have come to the conclusion, based on observation and scriptural
reading, that when a man comes to that complete living faith in the
Unseen Power and has become free from passion, the body
undergoesinternal transformation. This does not come about by mere
wish. It needs constant vigilance and practice. In spite of both, unless
God’s grace descends upon one, human effort comes to naught.
1

The article appeared under the date-line “Panchgani, June 12”.

VOL. 87 : 29 MAY, 1945 - 29 AUGUST, 1945

103

Conquest of passion—passion here does not signify animal
appetite; of course, it presupposes full control over such appetite—is
more difficult to attain. If it were otherwise, complete non-violence
would be easy of achievement. With all my knowledge of, and effort
at, non-violence, I have conquered my passion only to the stage of
suppression. This involves great strain on both body and mind.
Subjugation is the real need. It does not involve absence of feeling.
He who identifies himself with every living creature must feel for
every kind of woe and yet remain unaffected by it. Action proceeding
from such equableness is far-reaching, pervasive and quickest in its
effect. Naturally, it is wholly non-violent.
Difficulty of attainment need cause no worry. For, being on the
right track leads one nearer to the goal.
Thus, though I wish and even hope to live up to 125 years, what
does it matter, if I die tomorrow? There is no sense of regret or
frustration in me. And there will be no anguish in me over an early
death.
Nor does the wish imply slackness of effort, in view of the
prospect of a longer life. The wish, to be capable of being fulfilled,
implies readiness to leave this body without a moment’s notice. It
connotes an easy fulfilment, from day to day, of the daily duty. All
strain is an anticipation of death.
Death does not mean an end of all effort. The Eternal Law
which we term God will be a mockery, if death were the end of such
an effort. ‘Hereafter’ is a mystery into which we may not peep. We
should have enough faith to know that death, after life truly lived, is
but a prelude to a better and richer life.
Now for Ram Rajya. It can be religiously translated as Kingdom
of God on Earth; politically translated, it is perfect democracy in
which, inequalities based on possession and non-possession, colour,
race or creed or sex vanish; in it, land and State belong to the people,
justice is prompt, perfect and cheap and, therefore, there is freedom of
worship, speech and the Press—all this because of the reign of the
self-imposed law of moral restraint.
Such a State must be based on truth and non-violence and must
consist of prosperous, happy and self-contained villages and village
communities. It is a dream that may never be realized. I find happiness in living in that dreamland, ever trying to realize it in the quickest way.

DEAR SIR VISVESVARAYA ,

I got your kind letter of 6th instant with enclosures yesterday. I
read the summary at once. The following questions occur to me:
1. Have you or your collaborators enforced the ideas given in
your brochure in a village or a group of villages? If you have, I would
like full details with names, status and emoluments of workers, etc.
2. I seem to read a conflict in some clauses of the summary. Has
not the present war shaken one’s confidence in the stability of the
economic prosperity of the leading nations, and is not that prosperity
co-existent with the deep and distressing poverty of large units of the
same nations?
3. The tendency, according to the summary, should be to wean
the villagers from their present practice and to teach them to displace
their tools with “machine tools”, and handicrafts production with
“mass production by the use of modern machinery”.
4. If I have read the summary aright and if it reflects the nature
of the brochure, is it not an invitation to me to stop my “numerous
activities” whose one object is to secure the maximum benefit of the
villages in the minimum of time with the minimum of expense?
I have always marvelled at your zeal for and devotion to the
cause you have made your own. But unfortunately our ways seem to

not tell you about them when we last met, I am telling you now, that at
the Ashram the work is principally physical labour of every kind
including the cleaning of lavatories. If you do not like such work,
Sevagram will not suit you.

I had your letter of the 6th. Since I had acted upon it, I did not
reply to it assuming that Kanaiyo 1 would certainly write. I am also
constantly thinking about him. As long as necessary, he will go on
doing that work. Isn’t that my work as well?

you will bring credit to that office. I am enclosing a letter2 for Savita.

183. LETTER TO PREMA KANTAK
P ANCHGANI,

June 12, 1945
CHI. PREMA,

I have your long letter. I have explained the ideal to you. You
yourself can, by keeping it before you, answer all the questions in the
same way as every student of geometry can draw a line by keeping
Euclid’s ideal line in his mind. Now try to understand.
I know the ideal, and I will, therefore, utilize the services of
educated women only for the realization of the ideal. If necessary, I
will pay them enough for their livelihood. But they will give more
than what they take. If they do not, they will be of no use. If it
becomes necessary to run a camp to train them as teachers, I will do
so. Whether I give six months or twelve months or even more to the
backward class women will depend on experience. Won’t it? I shall
not bother about that, for, since they will be learning through
thecrafts, they will be paying their expenses, or will be fit to do so in
the shortest possible period.
What if people believe that I have failed? My failure is not the

ideal. And how can a man who is progressing towards the ideal be
regarded to have failed? Does the fact that you yourself, though you
have lived in the Ashram, are not able to live up to the ideal prove that
the ideal is impossible to attain or that you are unworthy?
If the admission of uneducated women to the camp makes it
impossible to run it, then it will be impossible to effect progress in
villages. Even if it is proved that Acharya Bhagwat has failed or even
if he shares your view, I will not be deterred. Our mettle will be proved
by our making possible what seems impossible today.
Sushila Pai is here. I will give her this letter. She will write
further.
And now the next point. I stick to what I told you concerning
Bhulabhai. He is here just now. It is 6.40 in the morning. He will leave
at 10. I don’t know that those who are in prison will be released. It
will of course be good if they are. If people are angry with Bhulabhai,
they should be angry with me, too. For he will not pursue his plan,
which I know, if I disapprove of it. I do not believe what the members
of the Working Committee are supposed to have said. And if they
have in fact said that, they have done so without authority. What do
prisoners know about conditions outside? According to my principle,
they have no right even to try and know. And even if they differ from
me, what does it matter? They will be free to do what they like after
they are released. I have no right at all to vote. Am I not only an
adviser? Don’t ever believe what the newspapers say. Of what good is
it anyway? If I knew that I should die tomorrow, such knowledge of
the future could only do harm. The same is true in this case. Yes, I will
say this much: Bhulabhai does not know what the newspapers know. If
so, how am I likely to know?
How can I or anyone else say what I would do in certain
circumstances? If you can guess about the future from what I am
doing today, you may do so. I cannot do even that, for I am daily
coming to realize more clearly that we ruin our lives by forming views
about hypothetical matters. There is meaning only in what we do
concerning what is actual. All else is meaningless.1
Don’t you still know my limitations and my approach? Didn’t
Kumarappa resign only after consulting me? Wasn’t I a party to the
offer of military help in the resolution of August 1942? What does it

matter if, while I do one thing, the others do the opposite and I let
them? And what else could I do? I would tell you only this: that after
having been with me for so long, and later staying away from me, you
now behave as if you were still with me. Even then I would advise you
to observe my actions and the views I express, think over them and
then do what seems to you best, feeling certain that you will have my
support in what you do. For I do not wish to make everybody like me.
My teaching is that everybody should be true to himself. Anybody
who has digested my teaching will never fall into doubt but will ever
go forward.
Manibehn also is here. I have left the rest to Sushila Pai.

It is good you gave all the details about Kamle. Bapa is not

condition we too would be deceived. We have arrived at only one
conclusion. I believe that as long as he keeps indifferent health he can
only be accommodated in the Ashram. He will be a burden if he
keeps on falling ill. You were right in advising him to take meat. He
can’t give up meat under compulsion. I will write to him in a day or
two even if I do not hear from him.
It is good that both of you have returned to Sevagram. I shall be
very happy if both of you can keep well. I was about to write “then
we have overcome the world”, but it would not be fitting. Why should
we put so much value on the physical body?

195. LETTER TO AMRITLAL V. THAKKAR
P ANCHGANI,

June 13 1945
BAPA,

I have received a pile of papers from Mridulabehn. One of those
is of course about her office. I am writing in that connection just now
in the morning. I had forwarded your remarks about the office to her.
She has raised an objection. It is justified. She says that if the minutes
cannot be amended, then her office should really be shifted to Wardha
for the time being. I have already expressed the opinion that it is not
necessary to do so. She can keep her office wherever she wants. If this
attitude is correct, and according to me it is, then it should be included
in the minutes. If it is not included, then her office should be shifted
to Wardha till the next meeting of the Executive Committee. It is clear
to me that that can’t be done. And it should also be clear to you,
because I have said that Mridulabehn can keep her office wherever
she likes. We must accept that her demand to get that change or
addition incorporated in the minutes is justified. If she raises her
objection constitutionally, I as President cannot deny what I said in the
Executive Committee meeting. I want to get the work done somehow1
because the main thing is that the work should be done. For the sake
of truth it is better to incorporate the change, if Shyamlal has not
already done so, and amend the minutes. Otherwise we should
incorporate it at my instance when the minutes come up for signing.
By doing so we can wriggle out of the constitutional requirement.
1

Literally, “I would have the rice boiled in any water that is available.”

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

Otherwise I, as President, must say that it is not obligatory on the part
of Mridulabehn to take her office to Wardha along with Bapa’s. If we
do so, we shall not then need any more money for the time being
because as long as another resolution is not passed, the office can be
retained in the Scindia House without making any payment and she
should manage with as many paid workers as there are today. We shall
do as you want. The first proposal accords more with truth, while the
second is more in conformity with the requirements of the situation.
In order to enable you to understand the whole thing better I am
sending you Mridulabehn’s letter even though it is marked personal.
In this connection I have to raise yet another question. Do you in
your inmost heart feel that it would be better if Mridulabehn gave up
the office? If you say that she should not leave, then we should have
some clear-cut decision in writing so that this confusion is cleared
once and for all. Draw up a draft in accordance with what you have in
mind or leave it to me and I shall make it and send it to you for
modification.1

I have your two letters. Give notice as you have suggested about
your office. I do not see anything wrong in it. I have written1 clearly
to Bapa. I won’t stop his office being shifted to Wardha, but there is
no need to take yours there. The women you have employed or had
employed when I came there will certainly remain. The office is also
there. Let it be there for the present.
Remember your resolve that you would work with men as a
woman and bring credit to the work. Have patience, do work with men
and bring credit to yourself and to your work.
You certainly did well in going to Mahabaleshwar. One should
look after one’s health. It is surprising you do not know this simple
thing. There is hidden pride in such an attitude. These are the
immortal words of Narasinha Mehta: “I have done this just as a dog
under a cart fancies himself shouldering the weight of the cart.”2 My
head spins going through your programme.
You should not feel bad that you have to write to me. You have
no choice since I have become the president. The source of
unhappiness is in the situation in which such differences of opinion
arise. I hope that too will disappear.

In his letter of June 8, the addressee had said that he saw no contradiction

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

own nephew and many others like him are doing both Hindi Prachar
work and Hindustani Prachar work. This creates difficulties. You
know Perinbehn. She wants to work for both. But the time has now
come for one of the two to be given up. If what you say is right, then
the need for this should never arise. In my view, it should be possible
for a person to be the President or Secretary of both the Hindustani
Prachar Sabha and the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan. That he may not be
able to do so because the work would be too heavy is a different
matter. And if your letter means, as it should mean what I also say,
then there can be no reason for any difference of opinion and I shall
be greatly delighted. I have gone through your statement that you
sent me. In my view the Hindustani Prachar Sabha is doing only your
work and therefore deserves your thanks. And you at least should
become a member of it. I had requested you to be its member but you
refused saying that you would keep out so long as Dr. Abdul Haq did
not come in. Now my request is that if what I write is correct and if we
both are of the same view, then this should be clarified by the Hindi
Sahitya Sammelan. If this is not necessary I shall not insist on it. But
at least it should be made clear that there is no difference of opinion
about it between you and me. It is no light matter for me to get out of
the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan. But just as I withdrew from the Congress
in order to serve it the better, in the same way if I leavethe Sammelan
it will be to serve the Sammelan, that is, Hindi, the better.
What you call my new ideas are not really new. It would be
more correct to say that I am now only putting into practice what I
had said when I first became the President of the Sammelan and what
I clarified further when I became its President for the second time. I
shall decide finally after receiving your reply.

Immediately on receiving Balvantsinha’s letter, I sent you a

after going through Balvantsinha’s letter. I could not have received
that letter along with the wire. Therefore I replied2 to Hoshiari immediately on receiving the letter and wrote3 to Balvantsinha meaning it
for you. Now I learn from your letter that you have gonehome disappointed. My advice was different. It is the same today, namely, that
you should stay on till I arrive there and then decide about Hoshiari.
She is not a little girl; she can realize her responsibility. She is also a
mother. Whatever you want to do you can do only after persuading
her. She is as dear to me as a daughter. She loves the Ashram. But I
do not want to make you unhappy. I want to under-stand your view
and then tell Hoshiari what her duty is. I hope that you received my
tele-gram and my letter while you were still at Sevagram and that you
have stayed on. If that is not so this letter will be sent to you at Khurja.

Your letter. You must not write when you have run down to the
extent you have. I can never misunderstand absence of letters from
you.
The restrictions are bad. But nothing to be done till you are with
me.
Hope all things will go well regarding family affairs.
I hope to go to Sevagram in the beginning of July. The weather
there may be too trying for you then.
I am well.

I got your letter. There was a letter from Kanchan from
Sevagram. You may come only when you can do so in a relaxed
frame of mind. Why should you ask for a message 1 from me? You

contrary, teach others not to ask for messages from me. I am writing

I got your letter. I do get news of you from time to time. I
would not at all like your going away from there. Kanti and Saraswati
serve you so well, keep you with them so lovingly. It is, therefore,
your duty to stay with them. How can you be a burden on them?
Moreover, you are able to keep yourself in control there. You should
not, therefore, think just now of going away anywhere else. The
climate of the place also is good. And certainly there are facilities.
You may even help them while you are lounging about. Your health is
not good enough to permit you to run about. The rains have started
here. Do not trust any rumours that may appear in the newspapers.

I got your letter. I am glad that you have settled down as a
family man and while performing your family duties are also
studying. Not many people can do that.
What is surprising is that Harilal has not contracted tuberculosis
so far. He had an excellent constitution and so he did not break down
completely. That you two could persuade him to stay on for such a
long time is a wonder. If he leaves you, he will go back to his old
habits, and be ruined. I kept back this reply for two days, but on
second thoughts felt that I should not delay any more. Pass on to
Harilal the letter1 addressed to him.

BAPA,

I write this while reading other papers from Mridulabehn. I
consider the question she has raised in her letter of the 9th justified.
She is the organizing secretary, so she must see the letters which
concern her work. If she sees them she can hold them back to discuss
them with you. Because, after all, she has to implement the policies.
Isn’t that so? Her argument that it will be difficult for her to function
as long as there is no clarification [about the division of work] and
that, if the provincial workers receive two directives, they won’t know
what to do and will get nervous, also seems correct to me. We must
decide after taking into consideration all these things.

The meaning of “It would be a different thing if you wished to
do no more than what I had asked” 1 is this: I had asked you to go
there for two months. That was what I wanted. If you stick to that I
cannot very well ask you to prolong the period, can I? Who will trust
me if I go on increasing my demands in this manner? I, therefore,
wrote to you that you must leave after the expiry of two months if you
stick to my demand. Mirabehn on her own will not detain you, so the
question won’t arise. Did I suggest to you that you yourself should
draw her attention about the expenses there? If you want I will do
that.Your decision about the child’s tumour is correct. Show him to a

P ANCHGANI,

CHI. KRISHNACHANDRA,

I have your long letter from Nagpur. As for Balkoba, all that
can be said is that there has been no steady gain from parpati. Now
we have to see how he can regain his strength. It will be good if he
does not find it too hot to be taken back into the room.
I still abide by whatever I wrote about railways, etc., in Hind
Swaraj. But that applies to an ideal state. It is possible that we may
never reach that state. Let us not worry about it. It is for this reason
that I have said that if we do not have railways and other such
facilities, we should not feel unhappy. We should never make it our
duty to multiply such facilities. At the same time we should also not
make a duty of giving up these things. We should have a free and easy
attitude in such matters. We must use these facilities as little as
possible. There will be all types of people in our society. There
certainly are today. We have to live with them. Non-attachment is the
only proper dharma under these circumstances. The only thing we
must be careful about is that we do not deceive ourselves. Your
statement that trains, etc., should be shunned even as theft, adultery
and falsehood is not correct. The important reason for this is that even
society considers theft, etc., to be immoral. Trains, etc., have not been,
nor need they be so considered. All that we may say is that we
shouldnot consider trains, etc., as means of enjoyment. I have
repeatedly pointed out in my articles where to draw the line. Read
them and if you give a little thought you will easily be able to draw
the line.

have to be certain rules to be followed. I had written1 to Bapa when I
received your suggestion earlier.
Bapa has been in correspondence with Prabhudas and Amba. It

225. LETTER TO JAGANNATHDAS1
P ANCHGANI,

June 15, 1945
All handicraft or arts which can be worked in village homes can
be and should be taught even though the products of such crafts and
arts may be and can only be profitably used for city people.
Thus carpentry, joinery, drawing, painting, sculpture, bricklaying, scientific washing etc., have their proper place in the institute.
These should not be taught merely mechanically. But the why and the
wherefore should be explained to the pupils, so that their intellect is
fully drawn out and disciplined in the act of learning and working the
respective crafts and arts. Thus they should be educated morally and
intellectually through these.
Secondly, if the first is carried out to the letter and in the spirit,
the whole institution must be self-supporting through the sales of
work turned out. For, in it there would be little or no overhead charge,
the idea being to man the insitution from top to bottom through its
erstwhile pupils, now turned experts in their respective departments.

226. NOTE TO VALLABHBHAI PATEL2
P ANCHGANI,

June 15, 1945
I have thought about your diet. I am of the view that you should
not eat anything fibrous. Hence, among vegetables you should eat
gourd and similar other things in which there would be very little of
indigestible matter. The main diet should consist of milk,
glucose,honey and, if you can digest it, butter. I think even vegetables
with seeds such as brinjals, tomatoes, should be avoided. They have
sent me from Coimbatore yeast made from bajra, which may be
good. The point is that you should eat only such food as will not
impose a burden on your intestines, and only a small quantity at a

227. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS
P ANCHGANI,

June 15, 1945
On the purely political aspect of the Viceregal statement 1 I
prefer to say nothing, now that the members of the Working Committee of the Congress are free. I can only give them my advice and it is
they who have to shape the policy of the Congress and speak and act
with authority.
As soon as I read the broadcast I sent a wire2 to His Excellency
the Viceroy drawing his attention to the fact that I have no locus
standi as the “recognized representative of the Congress”. That
function belongs to the President of the Congress or whoever may be
appointed to represent the Congress on a particular occasion.
For several years I have acted unofficially as an adviser to the
Congress whenever required. The public will remember that I went
with the same unrepresentative character for my talks3 with
Qaid-e-Azam Jinnah; and I can take up no other position with the
British Government, in this instance represented by the Viceroy.
There is one expression in the Viceregal broadcast which
certainly offends my ear and, I hope, will offend that of every politically minded Hindu. I refer to the expression “caste Hindus”. I
claim that there is no such person, speaking politically, as a “caste
Hindu”,let alone the Congress which seeks to represent the whole of
India which is yearning after political independence.4
Does Veer Savarkar or Dr. Shyama Prasad or Dr. Moonje of the
Hindu Mahasabha represent caste Hindus?
Do they not represent all Hindus without distinction of caste?

Do they not include the so-called untouchables? Do they themselves
claim to be caste Hindus? I hope not.
Of all politically minded Hindus, I know that even the revered
Pandit Malaviyaji, though he observes caste distinctions, will refuse to
be called a caste Hindu, as distinguished from the other Hindus.
The modern tendency in Hinduism is to abolish all caste
distinctions and this I maintain in spite of my knowledge of
reactionary elements in Hindu society.
I can only hope, therefore, that H. E. the Viceroy has alloowed
himself to make use of the expression in utter ignorance. I want to
acquit him of knowingly wounding the susceptibilities of Hindu
society or dividing it.
I would not have dwelt on this matter but for the fact that it
touches the political mind of Hindus in its sensitive spot and carries
with it political repercussions.
The proposed conference can do much useful work if it is put in
its proper political setting and is at the very outset rendered immune
from any fissiparous tendency.
Undoubtedly all invitees might appear as Indians conjointly
bent on achieving India’s natural goal and not as persons representing
several sections of Indian society.
That is how I have viewed Bhulabhai-Liaqat Ali understanding1
which I suppose laid the foundation for the forthcoming Viceregal
conference.
Shri Bhulabhai Desai’s proposal has no such colouring as the
Viceregal broadcast would seem to have. I am not ashamed of the part
I have played in advising2 Shri Bhulabhai Desai when he consulted me
about his proposal.
Shri Bhulabhai Desai’s proposal, as I understood it, attracted me
as one interested in solving the communal tangle, and I assured him
that I would use my influence with the members of the Working
Committee and give my reasons for acceptance of his proposal and
I have no doubt that if both parties to the proposal correctly
represent their constituents and have independence of India as their
common goal, things must shape well. At this point I must stop and
the Working Committee has to take up the thread. It is for its members
to declare the Congress mind on the impending questions.

234. LETTER TO LORD WAVELL
‘DILKHUSHA’, PANCHGANI,

June 16, 1945
DEAR FRIEND,

I thank you for your telegram 1 of yesterday received at 3.45
p.m. My second telegram2 , acknowledging your kind telegraphic
invitation, evidently crossed yours. I am sending you this letter in
reply, instead of wiring, because I am anxious that you should
understand my position thoroughly. However, I am sending you a
wire3 intimating the despatch of this letter. For ready reference, I am
enclosing herewith a copy of my Press message 4 which was issued
yesterday in the morning. I would like you to go through it.
While it is true that my position is technical, the reality of it is
truer. My official and legal connection with the Congress was
deliberately, and with the consent of the All-India Congress
Committee, severed5 in order to enable me all the better to serve the
common cause. This position therefore cannot be changed at will. In
the forthcoming official conference, I can have no official position.
My presence in it will change the official colour, unless I become an
official representative of the Congress. But if you think that my helpis
desirable and that without being a member of the conference I am
likely to be useful, I shall make it a point to be at your service before
and even during the conference proceedings, assuming, of course, that
the Working Committee wishes likewise.
I want to cite an analogy. You may have known the late
Deenabandhu, as C. F. Andrews was affectionately called by us. He
severed his official connection with the Cambridge Mission and the
Church in order to serve religion, India and humanity better. The
position he occupied as a valuable link between India and England,
whether official or non-official and, between all classes and parties,
grew as days went. If I can, I would love to occupy such a position. It
may never come to me. Man can but try.

You have suggested further consideration and consultation, both
of which I have done. I am within an easy distance of Yeravda Central
prison, where Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Shri Shankarrao Dev were
recently transferred from Ahmednagar Fort. Almost immediately after
their discharge from the jail yesterday they motored to Panchgani and
are still with me. I have shown them all the necessary papers and they
concur with me in what I am writing.
In the task you have undertaken, of which I fully appreciate the
difficulty and delicacy, you certainly need the assistance and goodwill
of all the parties. The Congress help you naturally cannot have
without the Congress being officially represented at your table. The
first and also perhaps the main purpose of the discharge of the
remaining members of the Working Committee will be frustrated
unless you secure the presence at your table of the President of the
Congress or whomsoever he and his Committee may appoint for the
purpose. If my supposition is correct, my immediate advice is that you
should invite the President of the Congress. I expect that the ban on
the Congress had been or will be lifted to the extent it still exists.1
I am,
Yours sincerely,

are here. I showed your letter to them also. The letter is clear. Think
over what I have done and watch what I am doing. If you wish to
caution me any time, you may unhesitatingly do so. I would even go
further and say that there would be no harm even if you wrote to

257. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS
P ANCHGANI,

June 18, 1945
This is perhaps an opportune moment to release the text of a
letter 1 I wrote to the British Prime Minister during my stay at
Panchgani last year. The letter was written in the small hours of the
night on July 17 at the same time that I wrote my Gujarati note 2 to
Qaid-e-Azam Jinnah and duly posted to be sent through H. E. the
Viceroy.
Unfortunately the letter miscarried. Having waited for a long
time, on September 10, 1944, during my visit to Bombay for the
meeting with Qaid-e-Azam, I sent a letter3 of enquiry out of curiosity,
for the psychological moment had passed. To my surprise, the Private
Secretary to the Viceroy wrote in return on September 13 that the
letter in question was not received by him. As I attached importance to
that letter, I sent4 him a copy of the missing letter on September 17,
1944, repeating the request that it might be sent to the Prime Minister.
My letter of July 17 to Mr. Churchill, in my estimation, was of a
sacred character not meant for the public eye, but I could contemplate
an occasion or time when it might call for publication without losing
the sacred character.
I, therefore, requested the Viceroy on December 3, 1944,5 to
enquire from the Prime Minister whether I had his permission to
publish it in case of need. He replied through his Secretary that
thePrime Minister agreed to the publication of my letter subject to the
fact that it was duly acknowledged.
The following is the text of the letter:
‘DILKHUSHA’, P ANCHGANI,

July 17, 1944
DEAR PRIME MINISTER,

You are reported to have a desire to crush the simple “Naked Fakir” as
you are said to have described me. I have been long trying to be a “Fakir”

and that naked—a more difficult task. I, therefore, regard the expression as a
compliment though unintended. I approach you then as such and ask you to
trust and use me for the sake of your people and mine and through them
those of the world.
Your sincere friend,

M. K. GANDHI

The Bombay Chronicle, 19-6-1948

258. INTERVIEW TO THE PRESS
P ANCHGANI,

June 18, 1945
What did you mean when you said that the Desai Formula1 had no
such colouring as the Viceroy’s would seem to have, and how do you think that the
Desai Formula would help to solve the communal tangle?
QUESTION:

ANSWER: Bhulabhai’s proposals have no colouring of caste.
There is the 50 per cent basis as between two political bodies. If
Bhulabhai’s proposals are the same as the Viceroy’s, then I am
greatly mistaken. I did not read the proposals in that light. According
to that Formula, if the Congress chose, it could appoint 50 per cent of
any community, non-Hindus, caste Hindus and non-caste Hindus. If
the Congress is obliged to choose only caste Hindus or even casteless
Hindus then it ceases to be Indian National Congress.
Asked if he was satisfied with the clarification offered by the Viceroy2 and the
Secretary of State3 about the question of independence, he said that it was a question
for the Working Committee to answer. He had his own opinion but he did not wish to
anticipate or influence the Working Committee by speaking to the public.
Q. What is your opinion about Lord Wavell’s personal efforts in solving the
political deadlock?

A. No one will know unless Lord Wavell chooses to write himself
as to what part he has played in this connection.
Q.

What do you think about the omission of the Hindu Mahasabha?

A. I have not thought over it, but as you prompt me I begin to
think. I do not know whether it is the method of putting the Congress

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

in the place of the Hindu Mahasabha and treating it as a sectional or a
Hindu body and if it is that, which I hope it is not, the Congress will be
one to avoid the whole show. But there is another construction also to
be put upon that omission, namely, that the British Government wants
to avoid the conference being based on religious distinction and,
therefore, for examining the proposal they have invited political
representatives only. Against this favourable assumption has
undoubtedly to be put the parity between Muslims and caste Hindus.
But I have publicly announced 1 that I believed that this mistake,
however grave, is one of ignorance. If my assumption is right, the
mistake would be corrected. Thinking along the same lines I account
for the omission of the Muslim Majlis or the Jamiat-ul-Ulema and
similar bodies.
I must not also omit to mention that the composition of the
conference is a very great advance upon all similar bodies, for, in all
previous conferences convened by the British Government, members
have been nominated by the Government principally. This time the
members of the conference are under no obligation to the
Government for their nomination and they need not vote or speak
merely to placate the Government. The Congress Premiers, for
instance, are under obligation only to the Congress as those belonging
to the Muslim League are answerable only to the League. So far as I
can recall there has been no such conference before.
Q.

Why do you think the Maulana was omitted in the first instance?

A.

Because the Viceroy thought that I represented the Congress
and the people had given him cause to think so. But I must say the
moment I pointed2 out the mistake he saw it at once and rectified it.

259. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING, PANCHGANI
June 18, 1945
Mahatma Gandhi addressing a prayer gathering on the eve of his departure
from here said he had planned to stay at Panchgani till the end of the month but man
proposes and God disposes.
He thanked Principal Batha of the Parsi Girls’ High School for allowing the
use of the school hall for holding prayer meetings and the girl students who sweetly
chanted prayers from the scriptures in the evenings.
To him the hall had become a prayer house where he found peace every evening
and got over the mental fatigue of the day’s work. He had nothing to give them in
return except his blessings.
They should know, he continued, that he was going away for the same purpose
for which he had come up to the hills. That purpose was the winning of India’s
independence. If he wanted to live for 125 years, or if he died that very moment, or if
he went to the hills for recouping his health, it was the same thing to him so long as
his very breath was dedicated to that aim.
His conception of swaraj was not mere political independence, He wanted to
see dharmaraj—establishment of the Kingdom of Heaven on earth—the reign of truth
and non-violence in every walk of life. That alone was independence to the starved
masses of this vast country.
He hoped that those who attended his prayers did not come there for the sake of
fun. They came to call the name of God so as to be able to do His work. To work for
the independence of his hope was God’s work.
To remain in slavery was beneath the dignity of man. A slave who was
conscious of his state and yet did not strive to break his chains was lower than the
beast. He who prayed from his heart could never accept slavery as his lot.
Everyone said that this time at last the chance had come for bringing India’s
independence nearer. He was a trusting man by temperament and he took statements at
their face value. Nevertheless, they should repose their faith in prayer more than in a
man’s work. Let them also know that we were all slaves of our passions. If we
conquered them, we could easily overcome the slavery under foreigners or our own
conquerors.

260. INTERVIEW TO P. RAMCHANDRA RAO
P ANCHGANI,

[Before June 19, 1945] 1
Is there a “Gandhian Plan”, as Prof. Agrawal2 will have it,
apart from the Gandhian programme? A plan necessarily involves a time schedule
within which to attain definite objectives. You have yourself formulated no such
plan?
QUESTION:

ANSWER: For me there is neither a Gandhian plan nor Gandhian
programme. But it would be too pedantic for me to object to a
friend’s use of the word “Gandhian”. Your objection to the word
“plan” is technically valid. But I am inclined to say there is no
substance in the objection.
The basis of the Gandhian programme is decentralization. But the core of
planning is centralization. Can planning and Gandhism go together?

I must dissent from the view that the core of planning is
centralization. Why should not decentralization lend itself to planning
as well as centralization?
Economic planning, says Prof. Agrawal, necessitates the least amount of State
control. Yet the plan he unfolds by no means envisages a Government which will
govern least because the emphasis throughout is on State action—“the responsibility
of the State is very great”. Necessarily, communications, public health, education,
trade and commerce, banking and currency, etc., must be State-controlled. And the
plan clearly supports the nationalization of key and basic large-scale industries. How
do these incompatible ideas fit in?

I detect no incompatibility in the idea of decentralizing, to the
greatest extent possible, all industries and crafts, economically
profitable in the villages of India, and centralizing or nationalizing the
key and vital large industries required for India considered as a whole.
Prof. Agrawal has taken illustrations from the present. When we have
independence cum predominance of village industries in the place of
city industries as at present, those who live to see that, as I hope
youand I will, will face another and much healthier atmosphere and
we shall see clearly what Prof. Agrawal and we see today only darkly.
Today everything is controlled by a foreign State. Tomorrow the State
will be controlled by the people (a very vital change in itself,) and if

VOL. 87: 29 MAY, 1945 - 29 AUGUST, 1945

157

Prof. Agrawal’s plan (pardon the word) fructifies, then it is obvious
that the State-control, though it appears to be big, will in reality be
least. Just project in your mind’s eye 700,000 villages of India
dominating the centre with its few towns required in the interests of
the villages.
The Gandhian programme is essentially a resuscitation of village
communities, ensuring the maximum utilization of human power. It is an
evolutionary process. Is it not opposed to a definitive State planning, unless, of
course, cottage industrialization is content to be complementary to nationalization
of industries which the problems of a post-war India may make imperative ?

You have correctly described the programme standing in my
name. You have lifted the term nationalization from its present setting
and then put a perplexing question. I suggest your correcting yourself
and examining the contents of the term in its new village setting. The
ideal is too comprehensive for our modernized mind. Mine may be all
a day-dream never destined to be realized. But that would be merely
begging the question. We see that in a single generation we have the
so-called impossible of yesterday become the possible of today.
You have recently declaimed1 against the big interests who speak loud against
the Government and give the lie by their support of it for the crumbs that fall to them.
It is answered that Congress itself has not been averse to befriend these
big interests who exploit the Congress for their ends. Can you not stop such
exploitation?

The Congress has never been, and I hope never will be, averse to
the big interests so long as it hopes to convert them to national use
instead of being itself converted by them in the process. My very
declamation referred to by you shows that the big interests have to be
on the right line, if they are to subserve the interests of the masses in
the end. Today they are relatively serving the foreign ruler whilst they
themselves merely get the crumbs from his table. It is unfortunate. But
all will never think and be alike. In non-violence, there is mutual
conversion instead of coercion.

BHAI BRELVI 1 ,

Your letter is good and also bad. And why again in English to
me?
Your health will be good. It was not through carelessness that I
used the expression to which you have drawn my attention. I had used
it advisedly. It is another matter that I may change it out of consideration for somebody, but then it will not express what I feel.
In the first place, the term ‘minorities’ includes, along with the
Muslims, all the accepted minorities. This has been my own preoccupation from childhood. And if you are concerned solely about
Muslims, I would like to say that sometimes when a Muslim was
wanted he was chosen not because he was the best Congressman
among Indians but because he was the best Congressman among Muslims and represented Muslims. I should be grieved if you did not
know this, because you are a highly experienced man and a journalist.
If you are interested in having the names of such minorities, I can
send you.
Yours sincerely,

[After June 24, 1945] 1
DEAR MAULANA SAHEB,

It was by mere chance that Pyarelal happened to see you. But
what you told him, if his report of the talk is accurate, is startling. The
Working Committee has not given you the right or the permission to
form a cabinet. You yourself told me that you could not do it without
the Working Committee. That is my view too. That was why I had said
that you should form a small committee with the assistance of the
Working Committee, which could be given that right and then act
through that committee or the Working Committee itself. Since you
did not react favourably to either of the proposals, I can only
conclude that I do not understand or do not know the stand of the
Working Committee in the matter.2 I understand from what Jamnalalji
says that you are going to summon the Working Committee anyhow. I
consider it improper. I would not wish you to be guilty of such a
grave error at this juncture.
I do not know what you have done and how you could
persuade the Viceroy. Even if you have committed yourself it is, in
my view, your duty to inform him that a mistake has been committed.
So much for the matter between you and the Working Committee.
Another thing I would like to tell you is that in anything you
do, you should take with you the Congress who are present and you
should put everything in writing.
The third is a personal matter. Ever since I first heard the
Viceroy’s proclamation3 , that is, while I was still at Panchgani, I have
been shouting that the Congress cannot accept the principle of parity
between Muslims and non-Harijan Hindus, an organization of Hindus
alone. Even if I am the only one among crores to do so, I shall refuse
to be a party to it. I do not care if the negotiations break down on this,
for I know and believe that the moment you try to form a national
government at the centre in this way you will be laying a wrong

There are several names in the Kasturba Memorial Trust. When
the Trust was formed, I had expressed a desire that your name and
Sardar’s should be included. All the Trustees were agreeable that the
names of you two should be included when you were released. I had
forgotten to consult you. It occurred to me this morning. Will you
agree to be on the Trust? It means working for women and children in
the villages and that too in my way. If you can take interest in this, I
can send you the papers for your perusal. I have said the same thing
to Sardar. He is considering it. I have told him that this is no matter
for honour. It is a matter for work.
The same is true about the propagation of Hindustani. I am very
keen on having your name for it if you are agreeable. I shall send you
the papers if you like, for your persual about this too. I am scared of

Vilas disappointed me.1 If you can help her to improve, do so.
I finished reading your booklet2 yesterday. I read it from

has shortcomings. In this connection I would advise you to read a big
book 3 Satish Babu has written on the cow. The first part of it is already
published, the second is about to come out. His full address is . . . 4
Calcutta. He is a first-class chemist. But he gave up everything long
back and took up khadi work. He is very industrious. He wrote this
book in jail. Those who want to work in the villages should read this
book. It does not contain only Satis Babu’s views. He has taken everything from British and American reports. There is much scope
forimprovement and addition in what you say in your book about
cattle, cattle diseases and land. If the villagers have to depend on

Government veterinary doctors for treatment of their cattle, it is not
going to work. This does not mean that the villagers are not to take
their help but their knowledge should be adapted to village
conditions. I have plenty of material on the subject but I do not want
to give it here. Perhaps you know Dhiren Mazumdar. He is working in
U.P. with Vichitra Narayan. He is Acharya Kripalani’s man and is
very industrious. He knows his work well. If you have not already met
him, do so. If possible go and see the Khadi Pratishthan of Satis Babu
and then bring out a second edition. It will not be of much use as it is.
Now that people have become interested in the subject they will buy
your book and probably read it, too. However, they will not be able to
derive much benefit from it, for, though they will know from the book
what they have to do, it will not tell them how they are to do it. This I
will expect in the second edition. I have seen from your book that you
are interested in the subject and so I have offered the suggestions.
One thing more. Take up at least one village, as I have taken up
Sevagram. Then put into practice the things you have said in the
book. In this way you will gain experience. This suggestion of mine
has another consequence: You will have to do very little legal practice.
You must be knowing that Brijkishore Babu, Rajendra Babu,
Vallabhbhai and others had to totally give up their practice when they
took up such work. I do not suggest that you go so far. You have a
vast knowledge of law and have gained so much experience. So with
slight modifications do as Motilal had done. While staying in a village
take up two or three good cases. Take the cases of the poor free of
charge. Devote the rest of your time to village reform. This is all I can
say after going through your book.

How can I advice you? These are my views: These days
educated men take advantage of the blind faith of women. Truthful
women will give up their immoral and unfaithful husbands. Even
educated women do not have self-respect and do not keep away from
licentiousness. A woman indulging in lechery is certainly lecherous
but the one who puts up with lechery is also lecherous. If you can take
anything from this you are welcome.

All the persons whose names were proposed were not at the Conference and substitutes had to be found for those of the absentees who
did not find it possible to serve on the Board. I had hesitated to give
my name for the Board, but as a result of correspondence with Dr.

few names.

310. DRAFT OF SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING, SIMLA1
[June 27, 1945] 2
Addressing the prayer meeting Mahatma Gandhi said that the object of
attending prayers was to commune with God and turn the searchlight inwards so that
with the help of God they could overcome their weaknesses. He believed that one
imbibed pure thoughts in the company of the pure. Even if there was one pure man in
that gathering, the rest would be affected by that one man’s purity. The condition was
that they came with that intention. Otherwise, their coming to the prayers was
meaningless.

He went further and maintained that even if all had their
weaknesses but came to the meeting with the intention of removing
them, their co-operative effort made day to day would quicken the
progress of reform. For even as co-operation was necessary, in the
economic or the political field so was co-operation much more
necessary on the moral plane. That was the meaning of the prayer
meetings he had been holding since his return to India.
Therefore, he appealed to them to sit absolutely quiet, with closed eyes, so as
to shut themselves off from outward thoughts for a few minutes at least. This
co-operative prayer needed no fuss, no advertisement. They must be free from
hypocrisy.

DEAR FRIEND,

Some hangings—an aftermath of the disturbances of 1942—
are impending. I have some cases given to me by Dr. Rajendra Prasad
of the Working Committee. The Chimur cases you perhaps know. I do
not quite know how the last stages of the conference are shaping. Be
that as it may, I suggest that all such hangings be commuted to life
sentences without further public appeal or agitation and whether
judicial proceedings are going on or not. If you think that this is
beyond you, may I suggest that these be postponed so as to be dealt
with by the national government that is coming into being?1

317. LETTER TO G. B. PANT
‘MANOR VILLE ’,

June 29, 1945
BHAI GOVIND BALLABH PANT1 ,

Yesterday I came to know that you had gone to Rajaji’s house
and there all of a sudden felt giddy. I was given to understand that in
any case you were not feeling too fit and that partly I was responsible
for it. That should not be so. I am very firm in my view and I should
be so. There may be occasions when you do not agree with my views.
So what? All of us, if we want to serve the country, should have our
own opinions. Only then can the country forge ahead and a way be
shown to the people. I firmly believe that you should not work at the
cost of your health. Stop worrying and do not feel unhappy that you
do not agree with my views.
The more I think the more convinced I become that if the
Working Committee tries to select as many Hindus as there
areMuslims then the communal poison will spread throughout the
country and we will never be able to win freedom. What is the harm if
the Congress is reduced from a majority to a minority? Must we do a
wrong thing to maintain our majority? Will not the Congress become
a communal organization by selecting as many Hindus as there are
Muslims?
If the Congress takes the fewest of Hindus, and as many as
possible from the other communities, the communal poison will be
removed and it will succeed in bringing freedom nearer. I quite see
that now the first step towards freedom has to be taken through
the Government. The course should be straight so far as we are
concerned.
If people do not accept this, then let the reins of Government be
passed to those whom the people approve. Everything will be all right
even if there are only a few straightforward persons. This is my
opinion and I can never give it up.

318. INTERVIEW TO PRESTON GROVER
S IMLA ,

June 29, 1945
In reply to my questions, Gandhiji said be was feeling well and that the
7,000-foot altitude of Simla had not affected him so far, although he was watchful that
he did not overstrain his heart.
Answering an initial request that he should give a report on the negotiations
as they stood at the moment, Mahatma Gandhi said:

I wish I could, but I am here only as an adviser. I have, for many
years, been advising the Congress. But now, I have constituted myself
as an adviser both to the Congress and to the Viceroy, too, and
through him of the British people. You see, that makes my position
exceptionally delicate. The only information I have is what my
colleagues bring when they come to me. Frankly speaking, I do not
know in what position the conference exactly is today. It has never
been my habit to cry out of curiosity.
It was suggested that the Congress representatives should keep him advised
almost hourly, to which he replied:

They do, and they do not. Unless the Viceroy wants my advice, I
would know nothing as to what is happening at that end. But, if things
go on smoothly, he does not need my advice. On our side too, while
they do come to me, it need not be from day to day or hour to hour.
While, therefore, I cannot tell you what exactly the situation in the
conference is, I can only share with you my hope and prayer that
things will come right both for India and Great Britain. I say for both,
because I do not know that, even if a settlement is pulled through, it
will be on right lines.
But I give you a tip. I was not joking when I made a statement1
some time back in answer to Sir Feroz Khan Noon at San Francisco,
1

VOL. 87: 29 MAY, 1945 - 29 AUGUST, 1945

that Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru is my heir. He has got ability, knowledge
and close touch with the public here and can interpret India’s mind. I
have already, as I wrote1 to Lord Linlithgow, taken him as my guide in
international affairs. He can interpret India’s mind to the outside
world as no one else can.
This much I can say, that Congress can never become sectional
organization. Not that there are not communal-minded people in it,
but the Congress can never work communally. Therefore, normally
speaking, the parity principle should be distasteful to everybody.
Turning to the composition of the current conference, Gandhiji declared it was
“political in its complexion” and not communal. This was in direct contradiction to
the Muslim League argument that the whole conference was chosen on communal
basis.

If they wanted various groups to be represented communally,
they should have invited the Hindu Mahasabha and not the Congress,
which has always been, and is now, a purely political body trying to
think and act in terms of the whole nation. It cannot belie its entire
history at this critical moment.
Asked if an acceptance of invitation to work for an interim government was in
the belief that it was a step towards independence, Gandhiji replied:

The acceptance of the invitation was a recognition of the
fact that it was a step towards independence. But this was subjectto
explanation and clarification of what was in the Viceroy’s mind. It
was like sitting on the top of a volcano which might erupt. I took that
risk.
Toward the end of the interview, it was suggested that Mr. Jinnah, President of
the Muslim League, was reported to be somewhat resentful that Gandhiji had
withdrawn from the conference.

If Mr. Jinnah wants me there, he can take me there. We shall
both go arm in arm. He can help me up the hill and save strain on my
heart. Such a gesture on Mr. Jinnah’s part would mean that he wants a
settlement even in the teeth of the differences and obstacles that face
the conference. You can tell him that I am quite willing to be taken to
the conference by him.
I suggested that not only Mr. Jinnah, but Lord Wavell, most of India and all
observers at the conference looked upon Gandhiji as head of the Congress regardless
of the technicality that he was not a member, and that no settlement would be reached

without his consent. Gandhiji replied:

That is both right and wrong. That impression has been created
because generally my advice is accepted. But technically and
substantially it is wrong. The conference is legally representative and,
therefore, I can have no place in it.
To my insistence that his was the controlling voice in the Congress, Gandhiji
replied:

Not even that. They can shunt me out at any time, brush aside
my advice. If I tried to override them, I might succeed for once. But
the moment I try to cling to power, I fall, never to rise again. That is,
not in my temperament.

much as you could include in it. I am writing this after the prayer,
since I do not feel like returning to bed. My work here has been
prolonged. But I do hope that it will end well. I had a letter from
Manu 1 from Poona. She expresses confidence that she will be fully
restored. There is [however] no letter from Vanu2 .
I set great store by the purification of the atmosphere there.
Purification includes cultivation of knowledge and devotion, diligence,
perseverance in the path of dharma, etc. Both of you should ponder
over this. Write to me and ask me. I had wanted to return there in the
first week of July, but that will not be possible now. That is why I am
writing this letter. I am glad you could see Hari-ichchha before she

327. INTERVIEW TO ASSOCIATED PRESS OF INDIA
S IMLA ,

June 30, 1945
GANDHIJI:

I have registered your claim but have nothing to say. I generally
don’t speak during day but for your sake I am speaking to you as a
special case. You have to prompt me.1
CORRESPONDENT:

What will be the composition of the interim government if

you have your way?
G. (Laughing) The interim government will consist of top
men, irrespective of caste, creed or colour. If I became the Viceroy of
India, I would startle the world with my list and yet make it acceptable.
I asked Mahatmaji to explain what he meant by top men, and he amplified his
remark by saying that he meant men and women who are fittest to do the work the
country needs. . . . The Mahatma said:

Of course, nobody will take the trouble of appointing me the
Viceroy of India nor of electing me as President of the Congress—for
I am not even a four-anna member of the Congress to be eligible for
election—with full authority to appoint the new government.
Mahatma Gandhi said that he would not hesitate to leave out anyone at present
in the Congress, if he felt that better men were available outside who would work in
their respective spheres so as to bring full independence at the earliest time possible.
I next asked:
In the course of your correspondence with the Viceroy on his proposals, you
objected to the term “caste Hindus” in the matter of parity of representation for
Hindus and Muslims, adding that if this parity between caste Hindus and Muslims was
1

According to the source, Gandhiji jokingly said this when A. S. Bharatan,
Special Correspondent of the Associated Press of India, greeted him. “Mahatma
Gandhi . . . seated on a simple mattress on a raised platform in a room overlooking ...
the snow-capped Himalayan. . . ranges. . . was actually enjoying the magnificent
scenery in front of him.”
VOL. 87: 29 MAY, 1945 - 29 AUGUST, 1945

195

unalterable, then the Congress would have no place in the new Government.1
According to the reports, the Congress delegates to the Conference have accepted
parity between Hindus other than Scheduled Classes and Muslims. Have you any
comment to make on this?

If Congressmen have accepted parity, it cannot be in the sense
you imagine. I interpret the Viceregal pronouncement2 to mean that
neither community can ask for more representation than the other in
the national cabinet. Thus Hindus other than the Scheduled Classes
can, if they wish, be less but not more than the Muslims.3
Do you approve of the procedure suggested by Lord Wavell yesterday at the
leaders’ conference for the selection of the new Executive Council, namely, that all
parties should submit separate panels of names to the Viceroy first and that thereafter
he would consult Party leaders before making his final selection and place the
personnel finally selected by him before the conference for approval?

The procedure suggested by Lord Wavell is, in my opinion,
good inasmuch as the Viceroy does not seek to impose his will on the
conference. The Viceroy has said in his opening remarks to the
delegates that the various elements represented in the conference
should regard him, the Viceroy, as their leader. It is a good and
dignified expression that Lord Wavell has used. He thus acts at the
conference as its leader and not as the agent of Whitehall.

334. DRAFT OF REVISED PHOENIX TRUST-DEED
S IMLA ,

July 2, 1945
In or about the year 1902, I, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi,
then of Johannesburg, Attorney, bought a piece of property about
100 acres in two lots, popularly known as the Phoenix Settlement, for
benevolent purposes. Not wishing to have anything in my name as
sole owner, I converted it into a trust and had it duly registered at
Pietermaritzburg, Natal.1
All the trustees, except Lewis Walter Ritch of Johannesburg,
Attorney, and I as settlers’ trustee, have died.
The settlers under the Trust have all retired from the Phoenix
Settlement. My son, Manilal Gandhi, together with his wife, Sushilabehn Gandhi, and their children have lived on the Settlement and
managed the property and the weekly newspaper Indian Opinion,
founded by me.
Now it is my intention to broaden the Trust and appoint new
trustees. Therefore the conditions of the present Trust shall be:
1. As long as possible to conduct the newspaper, Indian
Opinion, in English and Gujarati and other Indian and even African

languages according to felt necessity and convenience including resources but never at a loss. Any profits made from the newspaper after
the deduction of running expenses shall be returned to the Settlement.
2.
The Press Department may undertake job work and the
sale of literature approved by the Trust in the interest of and healthy
instructions of the public.
3.
The Trust may found a public library and school, subject
to rules made by the trustees and built from donations given by the
public. These shall be named after my deceased wife, Kasturba.
4.
The trustees may also found nature cure establishments
and undertake all activities that may educate Indians morally, socially,
economically and hygienically.
5.
All decisions of the trustees shall be by majority.
For the purposes aforesaid I appoint the following trustees
during life or at my discretion:
(i) The said Lewis Walter Ritch,
(ii) Manilal Mohandas Gandhi,
(iii) Parsi Jalbhai Rustomji,
(iv) Surendrarai Medh, [and a]
(v) [A] Muslim.
The said Manilal Gandhi shall be the Managing Trustee and,
while he is manager of the Trust and editor of Indian Opinion, shall
draw not more than one hundred pounds per month with free lodging
on the Settlement for himself, his wife and children. The said Manilal
Gandhi shall maintain proper books of account for the management
of the Trust property and the newspaper, Indian Opinion. Separate
accounts shall be maintained in respect of Indian Opinion and the
management of the Trust property. The said accounts shall be audited
every six months.
In the event of any of the trustees being dead, resigning or
being displaced by me, the remaining trustees may appoint another
instead, my consent being considered necessary during my life.

I have sat down to write love letters immediately after the prayer
today. The first I wrote to Bishop Westcott, the second to the ailing
Narendra Dev and this third I am writing to you. Doesn’t the ˜æè look
like Öè ? Can a pot have its neck reshaped after it is baked? But I
wonder whether this saying can be applied to a living pot. It must of
course have been first used by a wiseacre for an old man. So much for
joking, though not quite without meaning.
Though I am engaged here in an important work, all the same
the mind is filled with supreme peace. My window opens on the
Himalayas. As soon as it was known that I would have to stay here for
fifteen days, the mind turned to this spectacle. Since the house was
built for men accustomed to sitting in chairs, one can see nothing if
one squats on the floor. I, therefore, became shameless and seated
myself on a bench. Now the eyes are stuck on the scene, so is the
mind. Even while lying on the bench I can see something of the
spectacle. On a clear day, the hills are covered with snow. For a
spectacle better than this, one must go to Shivji’s Kailas!
My Kailas, however, is Sevagram. The life-giving waters of my
Ganga flow from there. Narahari and you, therefore, should devote

And if you do, are you ready to fulfil the conditions for that?

341. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING, SIMLA
July 2, 1945
Mahatma Gandhi drew the attention of the people to the new rule of the A. I. S.
A. according to which payment for khadi had to be made partly in yarn. This rule had
come into force from the first of July in Simla. People had said to him that Simla
Khadi Bhandar sold khadi to all sorts of people who came up for short or long visits.
Most of them could not spin and the sales of the Bhandar would go down if part
payment of the price of khadi in yarn was insisted upon. He did not mind such a result,
untoward though it would be.
There was a time, Gandhiji said, when they aimed at promoting the sale of
khadi to help the poor to supplement their income. But deep thought, especially
during his recent incarceration, had convinced him that if khadi was to serve as a
means of bringing swaraj, its scope and meaning had to be extended. He could not
keep a mighty organization like the A. I. S. A. merely for producing and selling khadi
for the sake of providing economic relief. Any other occupation could be utilized for
that purpose. If khadi was to bring swaraj through non-violence, millions had to spin
with the full consciousness of its implication in terms of ahimsa and independence.
The A. I. S. A. had started by asking for yarn worth only two pice for every rupee
worth of khadi sold. If he could carry conviction, he would insist upon the full
payment being made in yarn. If they loved freedom, they should not find it
burdensome to do that much—those who did not wish to be free had no business to
1

204

The reference is to Jawaharlal Nehru; ‘jawahar’, literally, means jewel.

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

come to the prayers. A man of prayer could never accept slavery as his lot.
If all had taken to spinning in the way he wanted it, Gandhiji said, they would
have had swaraj without any further effort. He would not have had to come up to
Simla. But society was made of all kinds of people. Therefore he had to come in
common with others for the conference to see whether it was possible through the
conference [to find a] way to further the progress towards independence.
As for the yarn to be given in exchange for khadi it should be either spun by
the individual concerned or by members of his family. The farthest the A. I. S. A.
could go was to let them take yarn spun by their servants whom they should treat as
members of the family. Yarn bought from the black market could not serve the
purpose in view. Also, if Bhandars began to sell yarn to prospective purchasers of
khadi, that would defeat the very purpose for which the new rule was being enforced.

342. LETTER TO LORD SAMUEL
[After July 2, 1945] 1

DEAR LORD SAMUEL ,

I have your letter of 2nd July. I am sorry that you are still
unconvinced. The ground of your objections seems to be that whilst
the Congress may sincerely wish to embrace all parties and is trying to
do so, it has not yet been able to achieve it and that its ultimate
achievement is problematical, while the taking of the delivery is to be
immediate and certain. This objection again overlooks the very
relevant fact to which I have twice drawn your attention, namely, that
the Congress through its president has invited the Government to
transfer full power to the League and ask it to form a truly national
government, in which it would have the loyal co-operation of the
Congress. This offer was reiterated at Simla. But I am sorry to have to
say it was again turned down.
I still adhere to my statement that “there cannot be Swaraj
without an understanding with the Muslims.” My contention is and
has been that the presence of the third party is the greatest stumblingblock in the way of this understanding. So long as one community in
the country enjoys the power of vetoing all political progress there
can be no reasonable settlement. In India this anomalous power is

assured to the League by the British Government which supererogates
to itself the right of arbitrating and holding the balance of power
between the various communities. In the absence of an agreed
solution, a just solution through impartial arbitration is held to be the
only feasible alternative in civilized society, but in India the absence
of an agreed solution is strangely held to be a justification for
retention of power by an alien Government over a nation of 400
millions ! ‘Quit India’ can be the only reply to such a claim. It
seemsstrange that you should see in this cry a manifestation of
totalitarian spirit instead of the anguished despair of an enslaved
people to be free from totalitarian foreign rule which has in the past
demonstrably sabotaged all their efforts to achieve unity in order to
be free and spurned their united and unanimous demands for political
advance.

I got up at three today. The reply 1 in Hindi to your two Hindi
letters I am sending to Wardha. I have gone through your latest about
Sailen. You may gladly give him Rs. 175 per month. I had considered
everything. However, I consider your calculations right. If he recovers
at Malad2 , there will be no difficulty. I do not like two boys having
been ill there. Is Sheth Jugalkishore any better now? And what about
the social worker, Satyavati?
You must not fall ill.

happy that both of you show so much devotion to your father and
you engage yourself in pure service of the country. But see that you
do not become impatient and harm your health. Do not overtax

The Congress list for the proposed Executive was sent to you
yesterday by the President.
1.
In spite of my earnest protest, the parity was preserved. I
was sorry. This does not mean any change on my part. I am more
than ever convinced that the non-Schedule Hindu members should
have been less than the Muslims.
2.
You will observe in the list the nomination of the President
of the Hindu Mahasabha. I think this was necessary and graceful. If
you accept the Congress list, may I suggest your inviting Dr. Shyamaprasad Mukerji before the meeting of the 14th instant ?
3.
Dr. Rajendra Prasad tells me that the hanging of
Shri Mahendra Chowdhury is about to take place on or any day after
12th instant. He is an inmate of Bhagalpur Central Jail, Bihar.

the proposed Executive is able to deal with it.1

You had said you would be seeing Dr. Khan Saheb and you
would then tell me how wrong he was in what he had said about your
drinking. According to the Doctor you had not seen him till the day
before yesterday. He himself tried to meet you but he could not find
you.
A lady who heard about this said: “I am a witness to the fact
that Bhulabhai drinks and associates with undesirable women. His
drinking and going around in the company of undersirable women is
known all over Simla.”
Even if this is true, you can still stand on the Congress ticket. I
was further told that at the meeting held at Maulana Saheb’s residence
you had crossed the limit of decency while presenting your case.
Even with regard to money, what you told me does not appear
to be correct. Even in writing this, my intention is to do good to you
and the Congress. If you cannot cleanse yourself, you must consider
all your talents as of no account.

Sevagram, and get things cleared. You, Bapa and I shall sit together.
A person’s originality or creative faculties should never die.
However, my experience is that one who has the zeal can cultivate
them in whatever situation he or she may be.
What shall we do if you get tired? But, if you really do, you
must take some rest.
I wish to leave here on the 15th and go straight to Sevagram. However, you, me and everyone else are in the hands of the
Almighty. We are relieved of all burdens if we surrender even our
wishes to Him.

398. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING, SIMLA1
July 12, 1945
Mahatma Gandhi referred to the serious inconvenience experienced by his host
due to unruly crowds. Some of them had invaded the house opposite to ‘Manor Ville’,
which belonged to Rajkumari Amrit Kaur’s brother and had smashed flower-pots and
damaged the railing of the verandah. When checked by the Rani Saheba they had been
rude to her. All this hurt him deeply. He would have liked to run away. But after all,
wherever he went the crowds would go with him. He could not run away from them. He
was their servant and he lived to serve them.
Some came to the prayers, Gandhiji said, simply to have his darshan. He had
told them often enough that he was not a mahatma. He was just one of them, an
ordinary human being. He must, however, confess that he called the name of God with
every breath of his life and in everything that he did he proceeded with God as
hiswitness. But that should not make him a mahatma. Every human being should act
as he claimed he did. That was what distinguished man from beast. Those who came to
the prayers should at least have decent manners. Even the soldiers in arms observed
discipline and behaved in an orderly fashion. These who came to pray should have
better manners, not worse. The object of coming to prayers was to praise God and for
doing that, purity of thought was a necessary pre-requisite. If they could not control
their minds, they should pray to God that he should enable them to have pure
thoughts at least during prayers. Gradually and with practice they would be able to
control them at all times.

CHATTOPADHYAYA 1
[On or before July 15, 1945] 2
Prayer is even more essential for the well-being of the soul than
is food for the maintenance of the body. It becomes necessary to give
up food on occasions in order to benefit the body. But prayer may
never be abandoned. If we provide food for the body which is
perishable, then, surely, it is our primary duty to provide food for the
soul which is imperishable and such sustenance is found in prayer.
The real meaning of prayer is devoted worship.
S. N. CHATTOPADHYAYA:

Why do you never look at your face in a looking-

glass ?
GANDHIJI:

Since everyone who meets me sees my face, what need
is there for me to employ a mirror?
Why do you not use a thick mattress?

I do all I can to merge myself into the poor millions of
India.
Why do you always travel third class on the railway?

The answer to this is embodied in the above.
Why not take salt and spices with your food?

Why should I take anything which is not essential for my bodily
needs?

407. LETTER TO LORD WAVELL
‘MANOR VILLE ’, SIMLA WEST,

July 15, 1945
DEAR FRIEND,

I thank you for your note of the 14th instant. It gladdens me to
think that you have appreciated my effort to advance the common
cause. As you perhaps know, I have arranged to leave here tomorrow.
A special from Kalka will carry me to Wardha by the kind courtesy of
the authorities concerned. . .
It grieves me to think that the conference which began so
happily and so hopefully should have ended in apparent failure—due
exactly, as it would seem, to the same cause as before. This time you
have taken the blame on your own shoulders.1 But the world will think
otherwise. India certainly does.
I must not hide from you the suspicion that the deeper cause is
perhaps the reluctance of the official world to part with power, which
the passing of the virtual control into the hands of their erstwhile
prisoners would have meant.
Be that as it may, what a pity that the moral height which the
British, if not even the Allied Powers, would have occupied by the success of the conference cannot be theirs, at any rate, for the time being.
I must not close this without a reminder about the Bihar
case. Your passing remark that it was one of ordinary dacoity,
calling for the heavy hand of law, disturbed me. This was not such

dacoity. The young man who is under sentence of death is no
professional dacoit. He is a misled Congressman under twenty-five
years (I think.) with a young wife of twenty years. I do hope that all
such death sentences will be commuted to life sentences. It seems tobe
the least demand of humanity, if not also of high politics.1
Yours sincerely,

CHI. SHANTA,

I got your letter yesterday. I am writing this after the morning
prayer. Address your reply at Sevagram.
You have remained as crazy after becoming a communist and a
mother as you were as a child.
Which Ashram has boycotted you? Where is the Ashram? Who
has boycotted you? Many communists have stayed with me. In the
same way you also can stay. You know that Jayanti1 had stayed with
me.
You should know that I have received many complaints, but I
have not acted on any of them. I am in correspondence with the Secretary2 . He had asked me for my permission to publish the letters and I
have granted it. Whether he has published them or not I do not know.
The Working Committee3 has taken no step. There has been no
time to consider the matter.
If Jawaharlalji goes against them, all the communists will have to
sit up and think. For he has a soft corner for the Party but he will not
tolerate anything unworthy. I myself have not been able to come to a
final decision. I have received quite a few complaints. I have sent them
to the Head office.
You have written your letter without thinking. If you calm down
and think before writing, you can help the communist cause.
You must learn to distinguish between communism and communists. Besides, Marx stands for one thing, Lenin for another and Stalin
for a third. The followers of the last are again divided into two groups.
Gandhi is one thing, Gandhism is another and Gandhi-ites are a third
thing. There are always, and will remain, such differences. Immature
people may identify themselves with one or the other group.

I have read all your letters. The last was that of yesterday. I
notice that you wanted to join me on my tours. That was my wish too.
But I had to forbear. As my stay was to be a prolonged one I did not
call you. That would not have been proper. I had engaged you for a
particular work. It seems you have not been very successful at it. You
will tell me about it when we meet. If you have to go to Rajkot again,
do go. But finish Narandas’s work first. If there is anything you wish
to say, it will be only after that and then I would like you to

April 25, 1945
A man does not become a satyagrahi by styling himself as such.
The observance of pure truth alone makes him a satyagrahi.
April 26, 1945
Is only that unclean which appears to the eye as unclean?
If there is even a little dirt on what is white, we feel annoyed;
but the black may have any amount of dirt on it and we care not at all!
April 27, 1945
We consider the black impure and the white pure. But black, in
its natural setting, is as much a virtue; as white, out of place, is a vice.
April 28, 1945
How strange that one who claims not to fear death fears it the
most, and seeks every means to avoid it!
April 29, 1945
A son’s obeisance to his parents is undoubtedly a form of
prayer. What homage, then, must we pay to Him who is the Eternal
Father of us all? Prayer may not be interpreted here in a narrow sense.
April 30, 1945
“A Thought for Today,’, published in today’s The Times of
India, appealed to me. Its purport is: “Believe in Truth, think Truth
and live Truth. Howsoever triumphant untruth may seem to be, it can
never prevail against Truth.”
1

Originally written in Hindi, these ‘thoughts, were translated and published
under this title by Anand T. Hingorani, who explains in the Preface that after the
death of his wife, Vidya, on July 20, 1943, during his eight week stay in Sevagram
from September 30, 1944, Gandhiji would greet him “every morning, after the
prayer . . . speak words of sympathy and solace, and . . . write down something . . . to
meditate upon. . . . From October 13, 1944, onwards he wrote continuously for a
fortnight, and then off and on. . . .” Before leaving Sevagram for nature cure treatment
at Bhimavaram, Hingorani had requested Gandhiji to write something for him daily,
which Gandhiji began to do from November 20, 1944, vide In June 1946, when
Hingorani sought Gandhiji’s permission to publish the ‘thoughts, in a book form,
Gandhiji remarked: “What is there about them that you are so keen on publishing
them? If, however, you wish to publish them, do so after my death. Such writings are
generally never published during the lifetime of their authors. Who knows, I may not
be able to live up to what I have written ! But if I live up to it till the last breath of my
life, then alone will it be worthwhile to publish these thoughts.” Gandhiji, however,
discontinued the practice by the end of 1946, as he put it, “for the sake of my
Noakhali mission, I renounced practically everything . . . gave up the Ashram, all my
companions and even writing for the Harijan. . . .”

Where there is hypocrisy, even if there is something good along
with it, do not go there even for the sake of picking up that good
only. If you do, it could be co-operation with evil which must not be
offered:
May 2, 1945
Just as we throw away milk if there is poison in it, so must we
reject any good which has got the poison of hypocrisy mixed with it.

Says Confucius: “In a well-ordered State, progress is not
measured in terms of wealth. The purity of the People and their
leaders alone constitutes the true wealth of the nation.”
May 4, 1945
Minds are of two kinds: one kind elevates, the other debases. Let
us constantly reflect over this and learn to distinguish one from the
other.
May 5, 1945
Just as only others can see a man’s back while he himself
cannot, we too cannot see our own errors.
May 6, 1945
Is not death, in every case, a release from too much suffering? If
so, why lament when it comes?
May 7, 1945
Life is likened to a rose; because life, too, is full of thorns.
May 8, 1945
Verily, there should be only one fear—the fear of doing
something mean or untrue.
May 9, 1945
Slipshod work is like half-baked bread, fit only to be thrown
away.
May 10, 1945
Why is it that man is afraid of speaking and practising truth, not
untruth?
May 11, 1945
There is an English saying, which is true, that “cowards die
many times before their death”. As I have often said, death really
means deliverance from pain and suffering. Fear serves only to
accentuate suffering and makes one’s condition pitiable.

By whatever name God be called, if there be godly attributes, we
must surely bow to Him.
May 13, 1945
Then, what should God be like? Passionless and Formless, He
should be a repository of all attributes and yet be wholly without
attributes. Why should God then be of masculine gender? This is
purely a question of grammar. The God of our conception, being
formless, is neither male nor female.
May 14, 1945
The breach of one rule inevitably leads to the breach of other
rules.
May 15, 1945
To rejoice in happiness is to invite misery. Real happiness
springs from sorrow and suffering.
May 16, 1945
Not contrived but genuine laughter is true eloquence, and more
effective than speech.
May 17, 1945
The contentment that accrues to man as a result of leading a
regular life, promotes his health and longevity.
May 18, 1945
Pride devours man completely. The truth of this can be realized
by everyone every moment.
May 19, 1945
On the other hand, modesty and humility nourish man and
make for his growth.
May 20, 1945
Every minute that runs to waste is irrecoverable. Yet, knowing
this, how much time we waste!
May 21, 1945
A needless word is also a violation of truth. That is why the
practice of truth becomes easier by observing silence.
May 22, 1945
Like a ship without direction or destination, labour without an
ideal is fruitless.
May 23, 1945
The power by which a railway train moves, an aeroplane flies
and man lives, is Divine Power, by whatsoever name one may call it.

240

The train is not moved by the steam engine; the aeroplane is not flown
by the motor; nor does man live by the mere mechanical functioning
of his heart.
May 24, 1945
“Sweet are the fruits of equanimity”—the truth of this is
experienced every moment.
May 25, 1945
There is a vast difference between obstinacy and steadfastness.
To seek to foist one’s view on others is obstinacy; whereas
steadfastness is that whereby we voluntarily impose something on
ourselves and which results in bringing others round to the acceptance
of our view of their own free will.
May 26, 1945
What should a man do when there is much work and little time
to do it in? He should have patience, do what he believes is most
useful and leave the rest to God. If God grants life, the arrear can be
taken up some other day.
May 27, 1945
I took off my spectacles to wash my face. I had intended to pick
them up later, but forgot to do so. Why? Because something else
engrossed my attention and so I became negligent. This is called
disorganization which is a dangerous thing.
May 28, 1945
A man is ashamed when he does something wrong. But when he
does something good, he wishes to let it be known. Why?
May 29, 1945
Envy devours him who harbours it. He who is the object of envy
remains unaffected, perhaps even unaware of it.
May 30, 1945
The opposite of envy is generosity. Generosity does not allow us
to be envious of anyone. On the contrary, if we find virtue in anyone,
we appreciate it and even profit by it.
May 31, 1945
Every moment I observe how man deceives himself.

Different people interpret the Shastras (religious scriptures)
differently. The right course is to follow in practice that interpretation
which appeals to us as basically sound even if it can be proved to be
grammatically unsound, provided, however, that our interpretation is
not opposed to morality and that it makes for self-restraint.

An untruthful person leaves many a loophole for himself. And
when he escapes through one or the other, he thinks he is very clever!
In fact, by doing so, he only digs pitfalls for himself.

A man of Truth, on the other hand, plugs all loopholes; or rather for him, it may be said, there is neither a wall nor any holes. He can
walk even blindfold on the right path and never does he fall into a pit.

413. MESSAGE TO STUDENTS1
AGRA,

July 17, 1945
[ GANDHIJI:] Study and work for the country’s freedom. This is
my message to the students of India.
Gandhiji said that he realized the despondency of the student community on
the failure of the Simla Conference2 and the danger of ill-feeling that might creep in
between Hindu and Muslim students. Hopes must not be lost.
Gandhiji stressed the need of unity among students and said it was deplorable
that a number of parties existed and things had reached such a stage that the police
were sometimes required to intervene. He wished that students of every creed, colour
and caste worked as a united body for the common cause. He advised the people [to
refrain] from indulging in mutual recriminations.
Asked if the Simla Conference failed on the issue of one seat given to a
non-Leaguer, Mahatma Gandhi refuted the contention. He said that he would publicize
his views regarding this problem at the earliest opportunity.

The Hindustan Times, 19-7-1945

1

On his way to Wardha after the Simla Conference, Gandhiji addressed the
crowd assembled at the Agra Cantt. station where the special carrying him arrived at
3.40 p. m. About a dozen local Communists, who had collected on the platform, were
initially disallowed by the authorities but they were allowed on the assurance from
them to remain peaceful.
2
The Simla Conference was convened by the Viceroy, Lord Wavell, and was
attended by leaders of the various parties, prominent among whom were Abul Kalam
Azad, Bhulabhai Desai, M. A. Jinnah, Dr. Khan Saheb, Liaquat Ali Khan, Sir Henry
Richardson, Rao Bahadur Shiv Raj and Master Tara Singh. Gandhiji did not attend the
Conference but he remained in Simla so as to be available for consultation. The
Conference, started on June 25, was adjourned on June 29 to enable the parties to send
the lists of the names for the proposed Executive Council. However, when it met
again on July 14 Lord Wavell announced its failure.

414. INTERVIEW TO “PEOPLE’S WAR”1
[July 17, 1945] 2
M. N. TANDON: Failure at Simla has disappointed the people who looked to a
change in the regime.

GANDHIJI: They should not be disappointed. The Congress took
a correct attitude and has vindicated its national character.
M. N. T. Mutual apportionment of blame has begun between the Congress and
the League leaders and the papers. Would this not embitter relations and dash hopes of
any future settlement, thus drifting to a position of civil war and riots?

G. Mutual recriminations should not be indulged in though truth
will have to be spoken. There is a danger of the situation drifting into
a civil war. The clash at Delhi station before Maulana Azad’s
compart-ment is a pointer. But the police should not be allowed to
maintain order amongst us. But if riots take place what can we do?
Riots have always been taking place. Even in the reign of . . . 3 riots
and disturb-ances took place. This country is inhabited by a very
large population of various conflicting ideas.
M. N. T. Civil disturbances of the older days were no comparison to those of
today with their political and economic implications. Patriots of the Congress and
the League would fight instead of uniting for people’s service, with the result that the
people would lose faith in the honesty and patriotism of both. Their miseries would
increase tenfold and the national movement would go to pieces.

G. Yes. We should make efforts not to let such a situation
develop.
M. N. T.

Do you hope that the Congress and the League will be able to settle in

the near future?
G. We should

all hope so.

M. N. T. The belief of the common man is that the Conference broke over the
question of a single seat due to dissensions among the leaders.

G.

It is wrong to say that the Conference broke over the question

Communist weekly, at the Agra Cantt. station on July

The correspondent here explains that Gandhiji had “mentioned the name of
some benevolent old Indian king, which I could not catch because of the noise on the
platform”.

of one seat. The Congress fought for a principle.
M. N. T. Even if the Congress had to nominate only Hindu Congressmen, they
could very well have represented the Nationalist Muslims and safeguarded their
interests. There is no difference between Congressman and Congressman.

G. But we were seeking able men of all parties and communities.
We did not bother which party got what number of seats.
You had accepted the Bhulabhai Formula1 of Congress-League parity
and gave a public statement 2 to that effect. But the Congress Working Committee
agreed to Hindu-Muslim parity, proposed by Wavell,3 thus raising the rock of
breakdown, since Congress and League could not agree to the nomination of one by
the other. Is it a fact that the Working Committee disagreed with you and rejected the
Congress-League parity formula?
M. N. T.

G. Now you are dragging me into deep water. Yes. The truth is
something like this. I shall write about it in the near future.
M. N. T. You perhaps know that the Communists’ main slogan all through the
Conference has been “transform Hindu-Muslim parity into Congress-League parity”
and they are making efforts in the direction.

G.

They should continue their efforts.

M. N. T.

G.

On what grounds did your correspondence with P. C. Joshi4 break?

Who says it has broken down?

M. N. T.

Has the Working Committee taken any decision regarding the

Communists?
G.

No. It has not taken any decision.

M. N. T. You know the ban of the U. P. Government continues on the three
Communist weeklies5 in U. P.

G. Have they not yet lifted the ban? It is very wrong for the
Government to do so.

415. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS
S EVAGRAM ,

July 18, 1945
The public will not like to know, as I have not liked, the fact that
I had to travel from Kalka to Wardha like a thief. I could do so only
by the courtesy of the authorities. Why should I have to escape the
embarrassing affection of the public? When I travelled by the Frontier
Mail from Bombay to Kalka 2 , at every stopping station it was a wild
demonstration. Accidents, even fatal, were escaped by miracle. Those
who were with me in the compartment had a rough time and two
wakeful nights.
Singly I might not have been able to cope with the din, noise
and hustle of the crowd. Of course this was not the first time that I had
to face such wild demonstrations, nor am I unaware that other leaders
have to go through such ordeals, but the fact is that each year makes
me less fit for them. My ears cannot stand the noise. I can do no work
among demonstrators and cannot make Harijan collections in such
circumstances. What is most painful is the fact that this wildness is no
prelude to swaraj, it is no sign of non-violence.
Crowds there should be to greet the leaders, but they should be
peaceful, dignified and completely disciplined. I have seen ordinary
soldiers in thousands observing perfect silence whether on the march
or at rest. Our crowds, if they are non-violent soldiers of swaraj,
should be more disciplined than ordinary soldiers. Will leaders of
volunteers learn a lesson from my train journey from Kalka to
Wardha and ensure perfectly peaceful demonstrations at stations and
elsewhere in all circumstances and not only or especially for me?

Today is your birthday. You will get this after two days. You

Serving is in our own hands, and happiness, too, if we but learn to be
equiminded in happiness and sorrow. Isn’t forgetting Vishnu the only
real suffering? Why should we forget Him?
I do not remember to have been annoyed with you. If I did get

eight days’ time. After that he intends to go there. It is necessary to
think now how he should be fixed up. He has considerable ability. We
have to consider which of his gifts to employ and on what tasks.
Personally I feel that it would be the most natural thing for him to
remain with me and get trained. But I would attach more importance
to your view, for at present my mind is occupied with the work lying
before me and, therefore, I am not able to concentrate it on problems
of individuals. If something occurs to me on the spur of the moment,

S EVAGRAM ,

July 21, 1945
CHI. MANUDI,

I have torn up your letter. It was silly. If there was any thing
private in it, it was your silliness. You had promised to stay there for a
year if required. And now you wish to go back on your word! Who
will trust you then? There is no harm in accepting money from Bhai.
He is your father. If you ask me, I would say that you should stop all
other thought and get well there. If the doctor is put to any expense, it
is for him and me to worry about. You may ask him for whatever
money you need. Your whole letter was silly. I was pained to read it.
Try and see if you can become firm in your mind. Ultimately you are
your own sovereign.

(1) There is some confusion. What is and what is not my
responsibility and to what extent is a matter of argument. In faith
there is no room for argument.
(2) One can try to be dustlike. Understand the suffix ‘like’.
(3) How can a person make his full contribution if he has not
become dustlike to the extent required by the Ashram?
(4) One can make oneself fit for the Ashram even while one is
away from it. People have done so and are doing so. This needs to be
understood. And those who have qualified themselves for the Ashram
will always regard themselves as being in the Ashram, no matter where
they go.

I hope you no longer grieve over Tofa’s death. Don’t have
another pet animal if you can restrain yourself.
Though you must miss us all, I am glad you have a little leisure
now. You were overworking yourself.
I look forward to your account of the visit you have referred to
in your letter.
Sushila had an attack of dysentery. She had lost 4 lb. up to
yesterday. She went to Bombay yesterday for the Sardar. There was a
phone that she was still suffering. I do feel strongly that medical
people should [not] suffer from avoidable complaints. Something
wrong in a system that tolerates such evils.
Well, I hear today from the Viceroy that the Bihar young man2
is to hang. It is a bad augury. I had forebodings as you know but had
hoped otherwise. Let us see.
My love to you all.

453. LETTER TO SHYAMLAL
July 23, 1945
BHAI SHYAMLAL 2 ,

There are two ways of serving the Harijans. First, by raising
them through education, etc., and secondly by rooting out untouchability from among the caste Hindus. The first course always bears
fruit and it is desirable to pursue it however little one can. Simple
‘Eradication of Untouchability’ does not serve our purpose. Therefore, ‘Harijan Sevak Sangh’ is a more appropriate expression. It is
true that so far very little work has been done among the savarnas.
The reasons are obvious. We lack self-sacrifice. Everyone, to some
extent, can do the work of spreading education. But everyone cannot
work among the savarnas for the removal of Untouchability.
Untouchability cannot be removed by delivering speeches. It will be
removed only by the power of our self-sacrifice. In such selfsacrifice, fasting has an important place. The fasts should be backed
by discretion. Something could be done if competent Shastris issue public statements. What Barveji3 says is not right. There can be no
separate village for Harijans because they are an integral part of
society and yet outside it.
They need wells, schools, etc., and if they are properly built and

if savarnas are allowed access to them, it would be one step towards
eradication of untouchability. Abolition of untouchability has political implications but it must be pursued with a purely religious motive.
It is a need of Hinduism. The answers to your more important questions are as follows:
1. Castes must go if we want to root out untouchability. Read
my preface to Varnavyavastha1 .
2. I feel that if it becomes necessary we should continue special
schools, wells, and so on.
3. Propaganda among the savarna Hindus is necessary. I have
mentioned its limitations above.
4. If there is a conflict with the savarnas for securing the rights
of Harijans, we must put up with it but secure them the rights.
5. The suggestion is good, but discretion will be necessary in
[implementing] it.
6. I consider the movement for temple-entry as necessary.
7. I do not know how far it is possible to have a meeting of
Hindu leaders. But there should be such a meeting.
8. The question of separate wells has already been dealt with.

BHAI TANDONJI1 ,

I have your letter of July 11. I read it twice. I then gave it to
Kishorelalbhai. You probably know that he is an independent thinker.
I also send you what he has written. I would only say that I have
always been as far as possible a slave of your love. The time has now
come when the same love will separate me from you. I have not been
able to explain myself. Kindly place this letter before the Standing
Committee of the Sammelan2 . I feel that the Sammelan has not
accepted my definition of Hindi. And now my ideas are moving
further still in that direction. My definition of Rashtrabhasha includes
a knowledge of Hindi and Urdu and both the Nagari and Persian
scripts. Only thus can a fusion of Hindi and Urdu come about, if it
will. I am afraid this suggestion of mine may not be welcome to the
Sammelan. I therefore request that my resignation be accepted.
Bypursuing the difficult task of propagating Hindustani I shall be
serving both Hindi and Urdu.

DEAR FRIEND,

I have just heard from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel that several
thousand Indian soldiers who had joined Subhas Babu1 in Burma or
elsewhere and who were captured during the recent anti-Japanese
operations have been locked up in the Delhi Fort and the ring leaders
(so called) have been shot under the decree of a court martial. I am
inclined to think that this is a bazaar rumour. Nevertheless, I suggest
that the public may be taken into confidence as to the true
situationand that, if there is any truth about the lock-up and trial, legal
assistance of their choice may be given to those who may be tried.
This is being posted after post office hours. Hence a copy under
a certificate of posting will follow when the post office opens

When I fixed the amount of milk, there were no other institutions in the neighbourhood. Now that there are, it becomes our duty
to sink or swim with them. We here cannot have the freedom that they
enjoy. But we must apply the controls that they do. The doctors are
engaged in formulating a standard. It will be published shortly. Just
now you should reduce the quantity of milk as much as you conveniently can. The final decision should be postponed till after Sushilabehn’s arrival. I should like to do without ghee altogether, but that
does not seem desirable for vegetarians. Experience will be a better
guide in this matter. Pulses cannot replace milk, but doctors believe
that they are necessary in themselves. I am the only one to assert

emphatically that they are not necessary. We may, however, introduce
them. The same about spices. Those who are under the Ashram vows
cannot consume them for the pleasure of the palate, but if they are
necessary for aiding digestion they may be used. It should be remembered that there are very few in the Ashram who have taken the vows.
I see no great trouble in having two separate cuisines—one with spices,
the other without. We cannot compel anybody to observe the vow of
controlling the palate, or any vow.
While considering this matter, we should remember that though
milk, ghee and fruit are consumed in greater quantity in the Ashram,
illness persists. We must investigate the cause of this.
If this does not give you the guidance that you need, ask me
again. The problem of those who are ill is a different one.

483. INTERVIEW TO “THE HINDU”
WARDHAGANJ,

July 28, 1945
QUESTION: According to Dr. Pattabhi, the Desai-Liaqat Formula contemplated
formation of a new government first, to be followed by the release of the members of
the Congress Working Committee. This aspect of the Formula had been interpreted
by some people as “bypassing the Congress” and by some others as “stabbing the
Congress in the back”.

You have stated in your statement issued from Panchgani that you blessed
the Formula as you thought it provided a basis for communal settlement. It is
generally believed that you were consulted at every stage of the agreement. Is
theinterpretation put on the agreement that it bypassed the Congress correct?
ANSWER: I consider the question has been addressed to a wrong
person. Parties to the Formula are the best persons to say what it
meant. Then what you put into Dr. Pattabhi’s mouth, he may
repudiate. I, therefore, suggest to all reporters at all times, but most
specially at this time, to be precise and accurate in what they say.
There never was the slightest intention on the part of Advocate
Bhulabhai Desai, on whose behalf alone I can speak, “of stabbing the
Congress in the back” or making an attempt to “bypass” the Congress. He, himself made politically by the Congress, could never be
guilty of any such intention, and, for me, I should be committing
suicide if I could be a party to any such attempt. I can say this much
for Advocate Bhulabhai Desai that the only intention he had was that
of honourably resolving the deadlock and thereby serving the
Congress. It would be wrong to say that I was consulted “at every
stage” but it would be strictly correct to say that Advocate Bhulabhai
Desai saw me more than once about the ‘Pact’.
Asked whether the release of the members of the Working Committee formed
part of the agreement, whether it was agreed between the parties that the Muslim
League alone should nominate the Muslim members of the new government and
whether in view of so many statements and counter-statements on the subject it would
not be desirable to release the Formula for publication, Gandhiji said:

I think, in the foregoing, I have said as much as I could, consistently with the fact that the ‘Pact’ has not seen the light of day. I wish
that the parties had agreed to release it for publication.

MY DEAR SUDHIR,

A man is sincere in the sense that he is not knowingly dishonest.
But if he makes up his mind hastily and will not deign to take the
trouble to study accurately facts of each case, he is in fact untruthful
without knowing that he is so. Such is the case with perhaps millions
of Hindus. They sincerely believe that untouchability is a part of the
divine plan. But they hug a provable untruth.

instead of the one at Simhagad. But that apart, write to me your views.

All I want to say is that the 12th Chapter (of the Gita ) is not as
easy to understand and to practise as you say. We can make anything
simple and easy by distortion. Here it seems to say the opposite of
what is said elsewhere. Here it seems to be getting increasingly
simpler. Moreover, we cannot assign to words any meaning we like.
However, if Vinoba accepts what you are saying, there is no harm in
following it. I have accepted the gist suited to myself.

I have just got your letter.
I am glad you saw the Vicereine. I shall send you by book post
what I can lay hands upon Sardar is none too well. Probably he will
have first to have nature cure and then, if necessary, operation. If he
goes to Poona, I shall have to go there. This may be the first week of
August.
Harijans have every right to curse us and abuse us. How can
they isolate the few penitents from the die-hards? Only we must go
on.
Sushila is with Sardar. She has lost all she gained there, I think.
You have to keep well. The secret is with you. No nibbling
between meals. No fruit-chewing or anything else while walking. Take
what you must at stated meals as so much for sustenance.
Sushila is likely to return by the middle of the week.
I am keeping well. I walk longer than usual. Today it was
exactly two miles. Usually it is 1_ miles.
Love.

I received your letter just now. You are so hardworking that to

if I improve my handwriting will I have the right to tell you to do so.
Isn’t that so? Even so I must say that I am writing this without reading

511. WHY KHADI FOR YARN AND NOT FOR MONEY?
July 1945
Sjt. Bharatan Kumarappa writes to me from his tours:
People are asking what has Gandhiji done. He will kill khadi by
insisting on yarn being given in exchange for it. What are we, who
because of his teachings have vowed to put on only khadi, to do? We
do not know how to spin neither do we want to learn it. Are we to go
without khadi? This rule regarding yarn only shows Gandhiji’s
obduracy.
Sjt. Bharatan Kumarappa’s letter is in English. I have given its
substance here.
People will not find any obduracy in my demand if only they
understood that non-violent swaraj depends on every drawing out of
the yarn. On the contrary they will then find absorbing interest in it.
Those who see only obduracy in it do not know how non-violence
works. Since my return to India I have been crying myself hoarse that
if we want to attain independence through non-violence spinning
should be an essential part of our activity. The late Maulana
Mohamed Ali used to say that the charkha was our rifle and the
spindles of yarn our bullets; we shall attain swaraj only through. these
bullets. This is as true today as when it was said.
My experience tells me that if khadi is to become universal, both
in cities and in villages, it should be made available only in exchange
of yarn. Today one anna’s worth of yarn in the rupee is demanded.
But this is only the beginning. When people have understood and
learnt how to spin, then khadi will be given only in full exchange for
yarn spun. I hope that as days go by everyone will himself insist on
buying khadi only in exchange of yarn. If this does not happen and if
they give yarn grudgingly swaraj through non-violence is impossible.
Surely some effort has to be made for swaraj. It cannot be had by
mere begging. A certain kind of freedom can of course be obtained
on the strength of the rifle, but it will not be real swaraj and I for one
am not interested in it.
The very idea of obtaining swaraj through the rifle makes my
head reel and a mountain of difficulties appears before my eyes.
Thisarticle is not meant for those who would obtain swaraj through the
rifle. Why should they wear khadi at all? From their point of view
khadi can be proved to be quite a useless thing. Readers of this article

296

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

should realize that if khadi is to be produced by villagers, not for their
own use but for sale in cities, and if crores of villagers themselves are
to use only mill cloth, then khadi will be of very little avail. How can
we rest content if khadi merely puts a few coppers into the pockets of
the poor?
A doubt is raised that this new rule will kill the khadi which is
now being produced by the poor and will make the wearing of khadi
spun by themselves a matter of fashion only for a few select citydwellers. This idea, however, displays ignorance.
The masses do not eat for fashion but in order that they may
live. Similarly they do not wear clothes for fashion, but for protection.
Therefore the charkha, like the oven, should find a place in every
house and every able-bodied person should spin. Then all can wear
khadi and obtain swaraj. Able-bodied persons should spin also for the
crippled and the weak. If games clubs demanding both energy and
money can be run, as they are, why cannot swaraj clubs or charkha
clubs be run where people can make slivers, spin and get khadi in
exchange of yarn? The truth is that where there is no will, unfavourable arguments present themselves and where there is a will, the will
itself discovers favourable arguments. If the will is strong nobody will
give up the charkha even as nobody leaves games. If the will can be
found for games, can it not be found also for swaraj?
A powerful argument advanced against the system of exchanging khadi for yarn is that if city people produce their own yarn the
khadi produced by the poor will vanish and the little relief that has till
now been given to them through khadi will stop, and the hope of
seeing villagers clad in khadi produced by themselves will remain
only a dream. Supposing city people give up wearing khadi out of
laziness or anger and villagers give up spinning and weaving for want
of demand, what great loss is it to the country? The poor people will
take to other occupations in the place of khadi and will somehow
make their living. Such people will not be found in crores but only in
lakhs as at present. Those who are engaged in bidi-making earn four
times what is possible through spinning, or even more. Many of the
mill labourers have become rich. This means that those who are
starving today will starve still further till they die, and the few of them
who can earn well will ride roughshod over the rest. If more mills are
increased and the number of cities is increased it will not make
Indiaprosperous. On the other hand it will make crores die of
starvation and of the many diseases produced by starvation. If city
people are pleased with such a spectacle I have nothing to say. Then it
VOL. 87: 29 MAY, 1945 - 29 AUGUST, 1945

297

will be the reign of violence, not of non-violence and truth, and I will
admit that in that case khadi will have no place, it can have no place.
Then military training will be compulsory whether we like it or not.
But what I am talking about relates to the crores of the starving
people. If they are to live, and live well, the charkha will have to be
central and spinning undertaken voluntarily also by those who do not
need to spin. The weapons of non-violence must not be adopted by
people because they have no other alternative. Therefore to my mind
the rule of yarn for khadi which has been introduced has to exist and
increase in its application. Exactly for the same reason, if all the khadi
bhandars have to be closed down and khadi-wearers give up khadi I
will regard it as a triumph of truth, because then I shall understand
that people had no belief in non-violence and that if they wore khadi
they did it out of ignorance and thereby merely deceived themselves
into thinking that by wearing khadi they would somehow get swaraj.
Why should I thus allow people to deceive themselves when I know
that such khadi will not bring swaraj and that it will be discarded after
swaraj is obtained? In that case the prophecy of the late Chintamani1
will come true that on Gandhi’s death people will laugh at khadi and
also at him and will burn his body with the charkhas they may have in
their houses. If hand-spun yarn cannot represent non-violence, why
should I not retrieve my error while I am still alive and save the wood
used in the charkhas? But I do not regard that prophecy as true.
People have understood that the crores of India cannot obtain
freedom through violence. India occupies or will soon occupy a great
place in the world. That will be possible only through non-violence. If
the crores of our people want to demonstrate the workability of
non-violence they can do it only by making the charkha central. As
the desire for freedom is strong amongst city-folks it is their duty to
understand this and to take to spinning and khadi-wearing in order to
obtain non-violent swaraj.

514. LETTER TO PURUSHOTTAM K. JERAJANI
S EVAGRAM ,

August 1, 1945
BHAI KAKUBHAI,

I have your letter. Chi. Kanu has given me the details in writing,
but I shall not go into them. All this misunderstanding arose because I
could not explain myself fully.
“God has tied me with a cotton thread. Whichever way he pulls
me I am His. I am pierced by the dagger of love.” This is from a
famous bhajan of Mirabai. Swaraj hangs by that thread; it does not
snap because the weight is that of love. The languages of India are full
of allegories featuring yarn. Narandas has conceived of a yarn bank.
If such a bank is organized well, it will ultimately beat the money
banks. Narandas is a supreme devotee of khadi. None among us can
beat him in his tapascharya. He has no other work. I am a witness to
the work he has done for the charkha. I am a lover of his work. He
has added immensely to the importance of Rentia Baras1 . It is not a
work of Kathiawaris alone and this time Kathiawaris alone are not to
do it. In this scheme the Charkha Sangh was to play a major role and
its benefit would have been also quite large. Chi. Kanu after finishing
his work in Bombay was to proceed further. Collection of funds was
Of secondary importance. Yarn was the main thing. The Charkha
Sangh had to collect only the yarn delivered at its door and send the
acknowledgement to Narandas’s bank. The ownership of the yarn
would have certainly remained with the Charkha Sangh. Suppose yarn
worth crores of rupees was produced, the Charkha Sangh would have
got it without striving. Chi. Kanu is a child, an errand boy. He is not a
leader. He could not explain what he wanted to say. From what he
says he did not absent himself so as to humiliate you. This thing was
such that there was no need for explanation. Goddess Lakshmi was to
come to your door to bless you. However, what has happened has
happened. I do not think it can be rectified. Do whatever you can. I
had reckoned that Kanu would go from house to house,
revivespinning, repair charkhas, enrol volunteers, collect yarn, and that
well-tied bales of yarn would be heaped at your place.

DEAR FRIEND,

Shri Sudhir Ghosh kindly gave me copies of your two speeches,
one of which I finished yesterday during moments snatched from my
daily work.
I write this to draw attention to two things for the moment. Cloth
shortage you can deal with without delay by following the policy laid
down by the All-India Spinners’ Association which is represented in
Bengal too. In one sentence the scheme is to ask every home
practically to spin its cotton and every village to weave its own cloth. It
is the largest co-operative effort that can be conceived in the world.
The second is the cattle question. For that you should meet Shri
Satis Chandra Das Gupta of Khadi Pratishthan. He is ailing andmay
not be available just now. He has just published a monumental work1
on the question.
Shri Sudhir Ghosh has given me your message about my
visiting Bengal. I thank you for it. I am anxious to come as early as
the rains of Bengal will permit. When I come my first business will be
to give myself the privilege of meeting you.
Yours sincerely,

I have your letter. I had asked Dr. Pattabhi. I did not feel it was
right to say anything when I had only seen the newspaper. Now that I
have received the letter I shall be writing something. I have seen the
telegram Rajaji has sent you. I agree with it. I [saw] something in the
Press by way of a directive from you about providing for the relatives
of those who died [during the struggle] in 1942 and afterwards. The
financial help we are at present giving to such relatives for their
maintenance and education is something different. In my opinion if
we go by truth and non-violence we cannot give such assistance. How
can we say that all of them died for the country, that they sacrificed
themselves for the cause of swaraj? I feel that under no circumstances
can you do that. If I may advise you, I would ask you to withdraw the
statement. I do not know whether there is still time for that. I am
sending you a wire today.

she finds the house on Rajpur Road dreary. We appreciate the
difficulties of Abdul Huq Saheb. He may therefore occupy the
houseon Rajpur Road. The rent is not much. It is a little less
commodious and therefore till he can make some other arrangement
he can keep the store of Urdu Anjuman1 on the ground floor of
Darussalaam. Abdul Huq Saheb himself may fix the rent.” In my

I have re-read the relevant portion4 of my reply to the
Government publication called Congress Responsibility for the
Disturbances, 1942-43. I have nothing to amend or correct in my
references to the Andhra Circular. Dr. Pattabhi and others as friends
and fellow-workers did have conversations with me on the topic of the
day. I have naturally no record of those talks nor did I authorize
publication of the talks. I have however contemporaneous evidence of
what I had in mind on 7th of August, 1942.
My draft instructions5 were circulated among Members of the
Working Committee on 8th August. They were to be considered on
9th August, but before they could be considered, Members of the
Working Committee and I were arrested. Hence no authorized
instructions were or could be issued.
I had no opportunity to function in terms of the A. I. G. C.

DEAR SIR EVAN,

I have to acknowledge with thanks your letter of 29th July
acknowledging my letter to His Excellency of the 25th July and I
shall await your further letter in the matter.
Mrs. Anasuyabai Kale of the C. P. Assembly has been to me to
tell me [that] the Privy Council has dismissed the petition of the Ashti
and Chimur prisoners to be heard in appeal against the judgement of
the Nagpur High Court. Unless, therefore, His Excellency uses his
prerogative of mercy the prisoners will be sent to the gallows. His
Excellency was good enough to tell me that he would consider these
cases and the like when the time came. Now is the time. May I hope
that the death sentences will be commuted?2

I could read your letter only today. What you say has a point if

Your argument is about khadi for the sake of the poor, mine is for
khadi for the sake of swaraj. The khadi work in Kathiawar is

impressive, but it is an obstacle to swaraj and will come to a stop
sooner or later. Those who wear khadi do so not from the khadi spirit
but from political necessity. Why need you spend your
indefatigableand boundless energy for that? If you can sell khadi on
the Charkha Sangh’s condition1 , you may do so. Give it to those who
observe it. Do not mind if, in that case, the khadi has to be sent
outside. If you do not have such implicit faith, you may go on doing
khadi work from outside the Charkha Sangh. Those who are willing
will learn from it. But do strive to understand my point of view.
Improve your health.
I have had a talk with Kanaiyo. He will tell you everything when
he arrives there. You may then guide him and me as to what we
should do.

535. LETTER TO MADHAVDAS G. KAPADIA
August 4, 1945
CHI. MADHAVDAS,

Dr. Krishnavarma has sent all the reports about you. Kunvarji 1
has also written a postcard. Dr. Krishnavarma has no interest
in keeping you. He has kept you only for my sake. He kept
Sailen also in the same way. Your good lies in remaining underDr.
Krishnavarma’s treatment and following his instructions. I think I
know Dr. Krishnavarma’s virtues and failings. For his failings he will
be answerable to God. I see and cling to his virtues. Many allegations
are made against him. Who is immune to them? I do not care for such
allegations. I have seen with my own eyes how he looked after Ba. I
think he had seen Ba’s virtues and became a great admirer of hers.
The knowledge that you are Ba’s brother prompts him to keep you
and look after you. You need not worry about how much you will
have to pay him. The doctor has told me that he does not want a
single pie, but I have decided that, if you agree, I shall pay him what I
think proper from out of your own possessions. I have discussed this
with Manilal too. But if you are not willing to pay a single pie, well, a
lot of money has already been spent over you and this will be some
more. It will be to the good if you get well and can live a normal life.
However, Ba’s last words to me about you were: “You have done what
you could for Madhavdas, I did what I could as his sister, and made
you do what you could for him. Now you need not do anything for

him.” This is what she said about you and Harilal. I know that these
words proceeded from her anger, but also from her love. I have not,
therefore, obeyed those words literally. Now do what you wish, with
God, whom you believe you worship every day, as witness. Of one
thing you may be sure, that I will not be able to keep you in the
Ashram, nor can I cure you. And remember also that no relation will
be able to accommodate you. Society is so constituted that even
though a person may wish to do something he is not able to do it,
cannot do it. Ultimately, everyone has to turn to God, and only what
He does or permits is possible. If you can think, then after reading this
letter stay where you are. If you cannot think, then also, do not do
anything in a hurry but stay there. May God bless you.

536. LETTER TO KRISHNAVARMA
August 4, 1945
BHAI KRISHNAVARMA,

Please read the enclosed letter and then pass it on to Mama. I
read your whole letter yesterday, till then I was not able fully to go
through it. I agree with what you say. I have given Mama some idea
of you in my letter to him. I had observed even when you were here
that you had no control over your tongue. You do not observe the
rules of cleanliness—maybe, you do not even know them. I had
noticed that also when you were here. I presume you are doing the
same there. Kanti Mashruwala is an admirer of yours. Manilal had
been there. He is not an admirer of you but he is wise. He has seen
something of the world. He recognizes your qualities. He believes that
you are no doubt good at heart but he also believes that you do not
observe the rules of cleanliness nor make others do so. I only know
your goodness and therefore wish that your shortcomings may
disappear. I know that I have served my own interest in sending Mama
to you and I still want to keep him there. He will be in a very bad
plight if he goes away from there. I cannot keep him in the Ashram,
as it will be against the spirit of the Ashram. I do not think he can stay
anywhere else. Whatever has to be done, you alone can do. As you
have started a hospital it certainly is your duty. Follow nature-cure

VOL. 87: 29 MAY, 1945 - 29 AUGUST, 1945

313

methods at the hospital. You must know the rules of cleanliness and
observe them meticulously. There are too many mosquitoes there. Just
because you are taking work from the poor women you should not
put up with their indifferent performance. As a doctor and a
householder it is your duty to teach them cleanliness. It should be
your job to eradicate mosquitoes from the neighbourhood. You
should know how to do that. How can you call yourself a nature-cure
doctor if you do not do all these things? I can write much along these
lines but I am sure you are one of those to whom a word is enough.
For this reason and also because I do not have the time I am not
prolonging the letter.
I understand about Sailen. Encash the cheque he has sent to
you. I won’t think it is your fee by any means. I know you did
notkeep Sailen for the sake of fee. But I thought he should on his own
put into the charity box whatever he could afford and therefore asked
him to send the cheque. Get the cheque cashed and utilize the money
for charity. I do not advise you to come here. The main reason of
course is that I do not have the time. Otherwise I would be happy if I
could keep you here and give you training in cleanliness. But that is
not possible at the moment. I shall call you when such an occasion
arises. However, if you want to come on your own, want to be
reassured and if you do come, it will be a different matter.

I have your postcard. You write that Mama should be allowed to
go where he wants. I do not understand this, nor does Manilal. Where
will he go? Where will he stay? Are you going to keep him? If you
think he can stay in the Ashram, that is not possible. Have you
considered what would happen if he were to go and stay in his own
house? Mama has gone to Malad of his own free will. When he asked
me to send him to Malad I was not willing to do so. I requested Dr.
Krishnavarma when Manilal pleaded on his behalf. It requires but one
moment to remove him from there, but I believe that it would harm

afterwards I shall not be able to do anything. I am convinced that in
doing so I am acting in an objective spirit and in accordance with

coming here on Monday with his wife and children. I will discuss the
matter with him, too.
I hope all of you are well.

538. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS
WARDHA ,

August 4, 1945
Several Congressmen have asked me questions relating to the
Congress programme. Cablegrams too have been received from
London and other places. I am sorry I have not been able to
acknowledge them. The reason, however, is and should be obvious. In
the absence of the Maulana Saheb and other members of the Working
Committee, it is true I took upon myself the responsibility to give such
advice as I was capable of giving in regard to Congress matters.
Now that the Working Committee is out, I can only give advice
through the Maulana Saheb and the Working Committee. My advice,
independently given, may be in conflict with their opinion and it may
embarrass them and even put them or me in a wrong position and,
what is more, may confuse the public mind. Therefore, I should warn
all here and outside India against making any reference to me on such
questions as are properly for the President and the Working Committee to advise upon.

I said then and I repeat now that my offer to Mr. Jinnah was not
in the nature of a bargain.1 It was my settled conviction though
originally derived from Rajaji 2 . I am not in the habit of deriving
anything from anybody, however great he is, unless I can appropriate
and assimilate it for myself. Therefore even if Rajaji went back on that
Formula, I shall stick to it so long as I retain my sanity. I hold it to be
substantial and also directly derivable from the Congress Resolutions
and immediately from the Resolution of August 8, 1942. Only I have
given it concrete shape.

August 5, 1945
CHI. KANTI1 ,

Both of you should learn non-attachment from the service of
Harilal. Through non-attachment devotion to someone can be
transformed into devotion to God. If such devotion is not linked with
devotion to God, it becomes infatuation and assumes a dangerous
form. You two have spared no effort in the service of Harilal. I had
felt all along that Harilal would ultimately act as he had always done.
But let not this worry you in the least. You should be thankful if even
the last rites fell to your lot to perform. You have shown devotion in
many ways. All that devotion will have achieved fulfilment if now you
turn it into devotion to God. And true devotion to God as I see itnow
is devotion to Sutranarayana2 . The word Daridranarayana3 was first
used by Vivekananda (if my memory serves me right, for I am not
quite sure whether it was he or some other holy man who used it first).
The word Satyanarayana 4 is well known. But as God of action it is
Sutranarayana who reveals Himself to me. You have started worship
of that God. Understand His nature properly. Rise above the intrigues
there or anywhere else. If you do not show the slightest softness to
Harilal, he will leave Mysore. Try to find out, if you can, how he
managed to obtain Rs. 200 from the Maharaja of Mysore.
You may tell me, when we meet, the other things which you have
on your mind. But do not worry if you cannot. If you wish to write
about them, have no hesitation in doing so. See that Saraswati 5 and
you devote yourselves to your studies and complete them.

544. LETTER TO RAMDAS GANDHI
August 5, 1945
CHI. RAMDAS,

You have used reasoning in your letter which, however, does not
appeal to me. You have a right to go to Dinshaw’s because he has
made you his own. Dinshaw is imbued with the spirit of altruism, even
towards the poorest. His is not an organization for the poor. Similarly
it is not for the rich. However, both can go there as also those
belonging to the middle class; that is possible because of Dinshaw’s
good nature. Moreover, you had no right to use reasoning the way
you have, for you had given me to understand that you were about to
take long leave, or had taken it, and would be devoting a year to
improving your health. Of course you will have yourself treated there
and think of going to Dinshaw only after you have completely ruined
your health. As you will yourself admit you could not perceive
Dinshaw’s love for you. I therefore even now advise you to take
oneyear’s leave and go to Dinshaw’s. As I have already told you, I
shall manage to find your one year’s expenses from somewhere. I
shall not pay from the Ashram funds but seek money for you from
somewhere. I have forgotten what arrangement was made about the
expenditure. However, explain that to me again and I will act
accordingly. You have something that attracts older persons to you. I
myself do not know what it is but I have firsthand knowledge of it.
Dinshaw knows many of my people but he is not drawn to them. But
he is attracted to you. Most probably you yourself do not know why
that is so. This is one of the instances. I have many others in my mind.
It would therefore be better if you did not argue over the matter and
went to Dinshaw’s. If you both want to go you may. It will be enough
for you to wind up the establishment from there for one year. There
are numerous teaching institutions in Poona. Kanam and Usha won’t
have any difficulty in learning Marathi if they have to.
Manilal and Sushila will be arriving tomorrow. Sita will stay on
in Akola. She is engrossed in her studies.
I am still of the opinion that Nimu1 did well in not going either
to Delhi or to Simla. There is no point in making Sumi2 dependent on

you. I can understand parents’ attachment. However, this time I have
seen that neither Nimu nor you could have done anything more for
Sumi than what Devdas and Lakshmi did for her. I noticed that they
looked after Sumi in the same way as they look after their own
children. Sumi gave me the impression that she also held the same
view. She is quite at home with the children there. Ultimately, isn’t
God the Protector of all? Gopaldas’s and Nalini’s son was gone in a
moment while they helplessly looked on.1 Nalini could not save him.
There are so many such instances.

CHI. SUMI,

I notice that even now you do not worship pure truth. You do
not even fulfil the promises you gave me. What is the meaning of
your pining for Nimu when you have accepted Devdas and Lakshmi
as your parents? They of course treat you accordingly. We should be
content with the situation in which we place ourselves or are placed.
For the sake of the love Devdas and Lakshmi cherish for you, you
must protect your health, your eyes. Why should you put yourself
through the strain of an examination? Why should you force yourself
to finish a specified course within a specified time? You have to
preserve your eyes, your intellect and your body in order to continue
with your studies. This is such an obvious truth that it does not need
any explanation. It is self-evident. Hence the Gujarati saying: the
health of the body is the first happiness. So allay Ramdas’s and
Nimu’s fears by studying without becoming restless and improving
your health. Bring credit to the love Devdas and Lakskmi have for
you and be worthy of it. I absolve you from your pledge of writing to

It is the same to an inmate of the Ashram whether he works as a
manager or as a sweeper. Being a sweeper probably entails a greater
responsibility. In being a manager there is no authority, only service.
One should be prepared for both. If one finds being a sweeper
pleasant and being a manager unpleasant, it is a sign of ignorance.
And, if being a manager smacks of authority it means one is
conceited. Keep yourself ready for managership. Do not bother about
whether or not you get it. I myself do not know when you may get it.

fever is now complete]y gone. In the case of typhoid one has to be
even more careful during convalescence because the disease weakens
the stomach. The diet therefore has to be watched. If the doctors
permit hip-bath can be of much help.
I hope Chi. Asha is perfectly well and so also is Jugal
Kishore. . . . 1 Will Rajendra Babu be able to put up with the dust of
Pilani? . . .2 I understand about Ghanshyamdas.

What I require is this. I want the rites1 to be the simplest and in
Hindustani, omitting Sanskrit slokas and mantras. For conducting it
anybody will do. What we do in this case will apply to all future
occasions. I think this covers all points.

CHI. MUNNALAL,

1. Write in brief. Number the paragraphs on the different
subjects, so that no point may be left out in the reply.
I am sure you will have realized by now that one has to reply to
points which strike one’s eye.
2. Since you are the Manager, you should treat nothing as
private.
3. This reply is meant for all. If you wish, you may treat your
letter as private.
4. Instead of compelling the women to attend the prayer, you
should explain to them their dharma and then leave the matter to
them. You cannot claim greater right or control over Kanchan than
over the other women. If you look upon Kanchan as your wife and
wish to have children by her or gratify physical or mental craving
through her, you should resign as Manager, notwithstanding your
many other virtues and endowments. That is to say, you should treat
Kanchan as completely independent.
5. Utilize Pushpa’s services to the full. She must learn to recite
the Gita with correct pronunciation. She can sing too. In thatcase let
her sing bhajans at prayer time. She knows cooking and can do all

domestic chores. She will do whatever work she can. If you take her
help, she will find salvation. She will become a devotee.
6. Hoshiari is illiterate, but she is firm, brave and does not shirk
work.
7. Kambale may have faults, but he certainly has some virtues.
He is a Harijan. It is our duty to serve him. This does not mean that we
should spoil him. It will be a great thing if you are able to understand
the secret that we can raise him without spoiling him.
8. Omprakash is capable of great progress. He seems to be a
good man. It is necessary to understand him. I have been training
him. If you do not think he may be a lustful man, you may let him
teach the women, not where he would be alone with them but in a big
room, or on my verandah or, if Sushila Gandhi permits, in Ba’s room.
Even if a man is a perfect brahmachari, he should never be alone with
a woman.
9. Ramnarayan1 will have to pay all the expenses. Since the girls
are to be given modern education outside, he will not be considered
an Ashram inmate. If he himself, however, wishes to stay here till he
gets a house outside, he may pay nominal rent and stay. But he should
not have a separate kitchen. Lanterns too should be shared as far as
possible. Even if he is ready to pay for them, we cannot give any just
now. It is desirable that we should make some arrangement for light
on the paths. Discuss this with Kanaiyo and Mohansinh. All those who
wish to read should do so silently round one or two lamps. And the
same for writing. We must economize on kerosene. Issue a ticket for
Ramnarayan. He should not be made to carry too heavy a financial
burden. All the expenses must be managed within Rs. 150. Everyone
should be given local fruit and Bombay fruit should be reserved for
the sick. I intend to make some arrangements. Estimate the cost of
fruit from Bombay. You should exercise discretion, moderation and
gentleness in this matter.
10. In order to know a man’s nature we must learn to tolerate
his weaknesses as we expect the world to tolerate ours. If the world did
not tolerate our weaknesses it would kill us. This applies to all, but it
applies especially to the Manager who has embraced ahimsa.
11. After you have finalized the set-up to your satisfaction, hand
it over to somebody else to administer according to plan. Let the
1

authority but for service. I believe that such an administrator can be,
ought to be, a woman. Any upright and hard-working man or woman
can run a well-planned organization. Take it that those who cannot do
so have some shortcomings.
12. About the trees Parnerkar1 says that there has been no
negligence. There has been some miscalculation, of course. That is,
the heat has harmed four or five trees more than was expected. The
rest are coming up. Exposing the trees to heat was deliberate, so that
they might bear finer and sweeter fruit. You should patiently
understand this point from him. He says he has consulted someone.
Learn more about manure. If I get time, I will try to learn something.
13. I am trying to arrange about Dr. Kelkar. About the others,
as time may permit.
Write if anything is left out. I have not revised the letter.

1. If proper arrangements have been made, only then effect the
change. Discuss the matter with both of them and do what has to be
done.
2. Ascertain Kanchan’s wishes. Does she crave for physical
pleasure?
3. Discuss and decide with S.behn the arrangements about milk,
jaggery, etc.
4. Do by and by what is possible about a common room.
5. Introduce weaving.
6. I am quite clear in my mind regarding English. I think it may
be taught to those women who desire to learn it. But they should first
have knowledge of the mother tongue and Hindi and Urdu.Menfolk
should certainly not be encouraged. As regards Harijans, English may
be taught to those who have learnt the other languages and then wish

MY DEAR ATULANAND,

R[aj] K[umari] has sent me your letter to her. You are right
about me. Your way is different from mine. But I have countenanced
you as you have appealed to me as an earnest man. In spite of the
testimonials you have quoted often, you have not made progress not
because Congressmen have not appreciated your labours but because
your unity plan has made no appeal to the general mind. But this is a
long story. I suggest to you to look inward for your failure and not
outward. Why not do some concrete work, be it ever so little? And
then there will be no failure. For concrete work is its own success. I
have not written this for argument but, if possible, to enable you to see
the light.
Yours sincerely,

559. THE MISSING LINK
[Before August 8, 1945] 2
This is what the Editor of the Gram Udyog Patrika tells me:
I am afraid your last article3 in regard to why people should give yarn
for khadi is not convincing. Your whole argument rests on the view, which is
repeated several times in the course of your article, that non-violent swaraj is
impossible unless everybody spins. This crucial point, however, is never
explained, but taken for granted and asserted repeatedly. Unless you can show

Vide “Why Khadi for yarn and not for money?”, july 1945.

328

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

what connection there is between non-violent swaraj and the people of all
kinds—even those who have more profitable occupation—taking to the
charkha for their cloth requirements, your argument cannot convince those
who honestly feel that your asking them to spin, if they want to use khadi,
even when their time can be spent more profitably, is to expect a little too
much from them. So can you perhaps provide this missing link in your
argument for the next issue, and show how through spinning we can obtain
non-violent swaraj?

The better course this time is to answer in English. Few, if any,
readers who do not know English would ask for the “missing link”,
for the very simple reason that, they know my argument showing the
connection between hand-spinning and swaraj obtained through
non-violence. Swaraj can only be obtained by work, either violent or
non-violent. Violent work we know. It necessarily includes training in
the use of the most modern weapons of destruction and all it means.
By common consent this has been ruled out. Mere constitutional
means, though non-violent, went out of date long ago. It is a
superstition to think that liberty can be gained by such means in the
teeth of armed opposition. Non-violent work is then the only means
for winning freedom. What is the training or work that Indians should
undertake for adapting themselves for non-violent efforts? It has been
shown that Indian freedom was lost when India’s chief trade in cotton
fabric, which was prepared in her cottages, was destroyed and together
with it many other occupations which Indians carried on to sustain
that trade. It is obvious that that trade and the allied occupations
should be revived or some others consistent with non-violence should
be taken up. Revival was the only thing thought of. It was being
attempted by way of copying the English or, say, the modern method
of replacing human labour by means of power-driven machinery.
Instinctively I rejected it [as] being a way of violence and sought to
replace it by human labour [as] being a way of non-violence.
The struggle between the two is going on. In my opinion, the war that
is ending has demonstrated the bankruptcy of violence. Solvency of
non-violence remains to be proved. Revival of the central trade of
India by means of power-driven machinery is possible only by a
superior exhibition of the resourcefulness of the West. And, if it
becomes possible, it will find the masses of India no better off than
now. I advance no argument in proof of this proposition. For, it can
be studied through a perusal of my writings already published in

VOL. 87: 29 MAY, 1945 - 29 AUGUST, 1945

329

book form 1 .
Then the only form of non-violent work to be done by the
largest number of men, women and children of the land, in order to
regain the lost trade with its attendant activities, is the spinning-wheel.
Thus conceived, it easily becomes the symbol par excellence of
non-violence. To be an instrument of swaraj, naturally it must not
flourish under Government or any other patronage. It must flourish, if
need be, even in spite of the resistance from Government or the
capitalist who is interested in his spinning and weaving mills. The
spinning-wheel represents the millions in the villages as against the
classes represented by the mill-owners and the like.
“Assuming,” the Editor asks, “that the wheel is designed to
bring in swaraj non-violently, why should a person who is more
usefully occupied or even disinclined spin?” The reason is more
psychological than utilitarian. The villagers have become used to
imitating the city-dwellers so much so that the movement is towards
migration to the city slums instead of remaining in and improving
their own lot in the villages. If every person sets apart, for the sake of
winning swaraj non-violently, a certain time for hand-spinning, an
atmosphere for spinning will be created and if khadi became an article
for personal use instead of being an article of commerce, which it now
largely is, the question of competition with mill-cloth or any other
cloth will disappear and the poorest as well as the richest will be able
to wear and use khadi without the slightest difficulty. No wonder
Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru has called it “the livery of our freedom”.2

I have your letter. I am in two minds about whether you should

should express no definite opinion. -We do not wish to enter into
controversy over the Vedas. The compositions that are today accepted
as the Vedas are full of unresolved doubts. Not all the writings have
come down to us. Even from among those which have, no one knows
what is genuine and what is not. As regards their interpretation,
sheerconfusion prevails. Hence the judgment about goodness or
badness can come only from a purified conscience. I have, therefore,
taken as my guide the sloka cited by Anandshankarbhai2 in his book:

Vide the preceding item.
Anandshankar Bapubhai Dhruva

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

I do not even know from where he has quoted the sloka. It
appealed to me instantly and sank into my heart, and I, therefore, got
it included in the women’s prayer. Also please remember that we got
the marriage of the Harijan girl Lakskmi and Harijan Velayudhan
performed according to the rite that we had accepted. I do not
remember the names of other Harijans. But all this I consider
irrelevant. If I am right in my statement that the regeneration of
Hinduism lies in our becoming Harijans, then it is very clear that a
change must be made in the marriage rite in all weddings taking place
in the Ashram or the ones with my blessings. Since I have already
agreed, Indu and Tendulkar should be married in the Ashram. I am
not bound as regards the rite, and, therefore, the new rite should be
introduced from this wedding. I am giving all this additional
information here simply by way of background. You may, if you
wish, discuss this matter with him. You may discuss it with Vinobaji
also, and then prepare as short a text of the ceremony as possible.
Remember that this must be finalized before I leave. I assume that you
also will be accompanying me. I saw the other photograph of Bal 1 ,

570. STATEMENT ON APPEAL FOR FUNDS1
August 8, 1945
I have gone through the appeal of the trustees. I like it. I hope
that the entire amount they have asked for in it will be available
through contributions. I feel that much has been done for the
propagation of Hindustani in the southern provinces and hope that
even more will be done in the future. People should contribute on the
understanding that the money thus raised will be used for furthering
the cause of the national language as I have defined it. The national
language as explained in the appeal is a language written in the Urdu
or Hindi style and in the Nagari or Urdu script. This means that the
Hindi written solely in the Devanagari script cannot be called national
language, nor can the language written solely in the Persian script.
The true Hindustani will be evolved only when we, who know the
national language, are able to write it in both the scripts and speak in
both the dictions. There can be no doubt that even today millions of
Hindus and Muslims in the North speak such a language, such
Hindustani. However, we cannot say that educated people of the North
speak such Hindustani. If it has to be our misfortune that such a state
of affairs should continue, then it will continue, but it should be our

hope that it will come to an end soon. This can be the only meaning
of propagating Hindustani. Therefore the work of propagating
Hindustani which is going on in South India will emphasize both the
styles. And that is the meaning of the resolution which the Congress
passed in 19251 . The resolution was:
This Congress resolves that the proceedings of the Congress, A.I.C.C.
and the Congress Working Committee shall ordinarily be conducted in
Hindustani. The English language or any other provincial language may be
used if the speaker is unable to speak in Hindustani or whenever necessary.
Proceedings of the Provincial Congress Committeeshall ordinarily be
conducted in the language of the province concerned. Hindustani may also be
used.

572. LETTER TO RAMNARAYAN CHOWDHARY
S EVAGRAM ,

August 8, 1945
CHI. RAMNARAYAN,

I have your letter. What would be the good of my sending for
all three of you here? It is unnecessary. I must admit I have not
understood your point. I had understood that Anjana Devi was keen
on providing modern education to Sita1 and Subhadra2 . I do not
consider it improper in any way. While going in for Nayee Talim, she
is free to send the girls elsewhere whenever she feels like it. If they
want to be educated there at present, you must stay somewhere
nearby. You will go to the Goshala when the building is ready in four
to six months’ time. Since no other accommodation is available
itwould be better if it can be found in the Ashram as was done in the
case of Prabhakar. I have written to Munnalal to that effect.3
Prabhakar used to cook his own food. I did not make this applicable
to you because I thought that except for the education of Sita and
Subhadra you and Anjana Devi had a preference for the Ashram life.
Therefore I felt you would not need to cook separately. But now I
understand from your letter that you do not like the system at the
Ashram. If that is so the Ashram life must be something different. But
I don’t think it is so. Understand that if the life and routine in the
Ashram cause you discomfort you both, or at least Anjana Devi, will
not be able to stay here in peace. Your cooking separately will hurt

BHAI VALLABHBHAI,

It is a pity that you cannot sleep while travelling. We shall be
reaching Poona in time, and shall see what happens there. I leave on
the 19th and arrive there1 on the 20th. I shall spend the day there and
then we shall leave for Poona on the 21st by the first train, assuming
that, as before, they will offer us a third-class compartment. Meanwhile take some rest if you can. If you rest, Mani also will get some
rest. I feel that she will not be able to endure the present strain for
long. Even now she is sustained only by her inexhaustible devotion to
you. But even devotion proves helpless in the face of what is but
natural. There was a vivid account in the newspapers of the Ahmedabad events.

580. LETTER TO INDUMATI GUNAJI
August 10, 1945
CHI. INDU,

This letter is for both of you.
I propose to solemnize your wedding on the 19th. The
ceremony is likely to be performed by Prabhakar. He is from a
Harijan family. His parents had become Christians.
The rite is being drafted by Kakasaheb.1
I assume that you approve of all this. I think you ought to write
to your elders and seek their permission.
I assume also that this marriage will not be for indulgence but
for service. I assume further that until real independence is achieved
you will not consummate your marriage. And of course I take it for
granted that you will not take to contraceptive methods.
I need not say that if you find all this hard you should not feel
obliged to have the marriage solemnized here.
If you approve of a marriage of this type, do regular spinning,
study the 12th Chapter of the Gita with interest and understanding,
and think only of public good while working in the Ashram.
Remember that in drafting this rite I have not taken the law into
consideration.

If both of you want to have protection of the law you may have
[the marriage] registered. Devdas has done it. So has Kanu. I never
wanted it, but the girls’ fathers were keen on it.
I have only expressed an opinion. I never pay any attention to

Brahmin, but what can we do if society and the law would not
recognize him?

584. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS
S EVAGRAM ,

August 11, 1945
Those like me, who were interested in saving Mahendra
Chowdhary from the gallows, are, I know, shocked that he was hanged
at the Central Jail in Bhagalpur on August 7. Those who remain
behind will have to know that many more such tragedies will take
place. Only, we must learn the lesson of each. Let us, then, now
dispassionately learn the lesson of this accomplished death sentence.
First, the Government. They do not call it a political dacoity.
Every dacoity is not a political act. Many professionals used the
political ferment for their own ends. Government, whether truly
national or foreign, would not let such crimes go unpunished. The
authorities, in this case, held Mahendra Chowdhary to be implicated in
such a dacoity and, therefore, they allowed the sentence to take the
extreme course. Now, for the popular side. They say that Mahendra
Chowdhary was a young man of twenty-five. He had no idea of taking
part in a dacoity whether professional or political, so-called. He was in
hiding. He was tried after the event and sentenced on doubtful
evidence.Acceptance of the evidence and the verdict depended on the
whim of the judge or judges and at the time judges were, as often as
not, biased.
1

The contents of the letter indicate that this was written after the letter to the
addressee dated August 10, 1945; vide “Letter to Indumati Gunaji”, 10-8-1945.

VOL. 87 : 29 MAY, 1945 - 29 AUGUST, 1945

If the popular belief is founded on fact, the death was a murder,
worse, reprehensible because judicial. Who can find the truth, except a
body of utterly impartial lawyers? They have to do so from the
recorded evidence and the judgements of the original and appellate
courts. Let us neither be carried away by sentiment nor lazily forget
the incident, now that Mahendra Chowdhary is no more. If
Government at all care for public opinion and would not rest on the
overwhelming force they have at their disposal, they will be equally
interested, and will associate themselves with the public.

CHI. MUNNALAL,

Read the accompanying letter. I like it. Kanchan writes what she
feels. I think it is necessary that she should be satisfied. How can she
be forced against her will? But I doubt very much if you two can stay
together in the Ashram. It seems to me impossible that you may stay
in a house of your own in the Ashram and still refrain from sexual
gratification. Kanchan at any rate will not be able to do so. And,
knowing you as I do, I can say that you also will not be able to do so.
Ramprasad is not an Ashram inmate. He is a paid worker and runs a
separate kitchen of his own. Even so, I am not reconciled to their
gratification of physical desire. But having engaged him I am helpless. His case, like Niyamat’s, should not be cited as a precedent. Think calmly over all this and write to me. I understand about Hiramani.

you from the rest or of expecting you to suppress anything. You were
represented as being very ill and so there was a mention of your
illness and special urgency of your release. Asaf3 had no hand in it.
So far as I know he came to know of the letter after it was dispatched.
Will you not give him and to everyone else the liberty of free thought
that you claim for yourself? I hope you are well.

I have even written to Maulana Saheb, though not in your
fashion. It is a difficult job. There can be no two opinions that before
taking any particular step he should consult you all.
What I had written to Jinnah Saheb was final, and, therefore, I
cannot do anything different. But you and others have a right
todisagree with what I wrote. If you cannot endorse it from your heart,
you should declare that openly. I did not speak on anybody’s behalf,
but merely expressed my own opinion. If I see any error in what I did,
I would immediately admit it. You know well enough that he likes
nothing that I suggest. But don’t worry about it.
New elections must be held. But it is not certain that they will be.
If they are held, we shall see. More in Poona.
I can fully understand your inability to come here. Railway
travelling is no longer possible for you. Will it be less painful if you
fly from Bombay to Poona?

If the manure was lying there because of paucity of labour you
should have taken help from the Ashram inmates. You will remember
you have asked for such help before. There was no point in shifting
itfrom one place to another. It can be used for vegetables; but the
question is whether it is more useful for the fruit trees or for the
vegetables. I felt that your reply was not straight. If we have been
negligent it is our duty to own it.
(2) I will myself see about the trees.
(3) I shall be pleased if Shri Patil and his sister-in-law live in the
Ashram and work in the Goshala. But have a talk with Munnalalji and
write to Patil what he says.
(4) I will certainly like it if Ramnarayan can stay in the Goshala.
Ask him whether he wishes to stay or not. I was under the impression
that at the moment it is not possible to accommodate him under any
circumstances.
(5) Does the Hindustani Talimi Sangh want developed land? I
thought it was otherwise. We must give the land. Put down everything
in Writing and let me know. Let them have it on a nominal rent, for a
specific period. Give them the right to return the land.

were all young girls with the exception of Saundaram. You on the
other hand ought to raise more important questions. How will it look
if you desired progeny before the coming of independence?
I shall not forbid you from inviting those people if you wish.
Will they have to be served a meal here? Tell me after thinking over it.
Show me my letter. Does my language imply a condition?

This is a different matter. When you say that I laid down a
condition which was not there earlier, I maintain that I have stipulated
no such condition. This is why I made the inquiry. I can do
something only on the assumption that neither of you will be a
hypocrite. In the event of hypocrisy I shall not be losing anything;
only you two will stand to lose. This has been my experience to date.
Those who betrayed me have ultimately fallen.

610. DISCUSSION WITH B. S. MURTHY 1
[Before August 14, 1945] 2
I can give you advice only as from one individual to another. I
am not giving any advice to the Harijan Sevak Sangh which is an
institution. After all the Harijan Sevak Sangh is only as good as the
best men in it and I know how few they are. The Sangh has done
substantial work, though not in the estimation of the Harijans or in the
estimation of the orthodox Hindus. The Harijans may want to smash
the caste Hindus and the caste Hindus may want to cling to the old
way. The Sangh has to face both these.
You have asked me how the Sangh can be revitalized. I know
the royal way is a fast by me. I might fast again and that more readily
for Harijans than for anything else. But I must wait till God asks me to
do it. There is no such thing as a forced fast. It has to come and I
cannot say now when it will come. I must also tell you that there are
others who want to fast for the Harijans. But I have told them that they
are not to fast while I am alive. I have also the idea of a chain of fasts.
In such a chain I will fast first and then when my body has perished,
the next fast will begin and it will go on till untouchability is no more.
Such a fast is conceived, but it cannot be taken up at once as I said it
has to come. But before even such a thing happens a lot of spade
work has to be done. That is why Harijan Sevak Sangh workers are

meeting here soon. They are meeting for the very purpose of
revitalizing the Sangh’s work.
The present feeling among the Harijan Sevak Sangh workers is
that practically nothing has been done among caste Hindus.
Education of Harijans is one thing; education of Savarnas is another
and as I know more difficult. You can educate Harijans by giving
them scholarships, hostels, etc., but no such way is possible among the
caste Hindus. The task, therefore, is to educate the savarnas. But this
can be done only by those who are fired by a living faith in the
Hinduism which I understand. Only those who fully know the
meaningof Hinduism as I know it can perform the miracle. Let us not
forget that untouchability is a most difficult thing to remove and that
our task is a heavy one. But I have no doubt that God will remove
untou-chability or remove Hinduism.
Now in regard to your question on the political future of
Harijans, I certainly see that those Harijans who have become politically conscious should straightaway have a full opportunity to figure
in politics. You have asked me what I mean by saying that I want such
Harijans to be more than a match for all other political competitors.
Many people weigh the Harijans in some special Harijan balance. But
I want to weigh the Harijans in the same balance in which I weigh the
best. You have to outweigh others because you have to cover so much
lost distance. That is why I expect from the Harijans greater effort
than from others.
You have asked me whether Dr. Ambedkar has in my opinion
thus proved himself to be more than a match. My answer is ‘Yes’ and
‘No’. Dr. Ambedkar is a fierce and fearless man. He does not scruple
to beat the Hindu dog with any stick he can get. He wants to destroy
Hinduism. It is open to him to do it. If the Harijans want to do it they
can do it. Then the Harijans must become the destroyers of Hinduism.
I want Harijans to become as able and earnest as Dr. Ambedkar but in
a different way. I want you to do even better. I want you to produce
sterling men who will reshape the whole of our society. It is not
enough to be educated. It is necessary to be cultured and fearless.
Such men who will reshape society will have to work among the
people and not cut themselves away from the people. They will have
to be stern, incorruptible and self-reliant. There is nothing to prevent
such people from taking any assistance from clean quarters. But my
point is the more you lean on such assistance, the more difficult
becomes the task of uplifting the Harijans.

623. SPEECH AT CENTRAL BOARD, HARIJAN SEVAK
SANGH
WARDHA ,

August 14, 1945
Gandhiji said that only caste Hindus and no Harijan should be taken on the
Executive of the Sangh, as it was the caste Hindus who had to atone for their sin of
prolonging untouchability. Harijans could be members of the supervision committee
that might be set up for carrying on the work properly.
Replying to a question, Gandhiji said that he would appreciate the principle of
satyagraha for enforcing the civic rights of Harijans in public places like tanks,
wells, temples, etc. He, however, emphasized that the Harijan Sevak Sangh as an
organization should not be involved in such a satyagraha. Individual Harijan workers
might try that remedy with the help of others.
Gandhiji explained to the members how Harijan work was to be carried on. Persistent
propaganda for changing the hearts of the orthodox and caste Hindus, hesaid, would
greatly help to solve the problem of untouchability which was a stigma on Hinduism.
To create confidence among Harijans, Mahatma Gandhi went on, Harijan
workers had to live amidst Harijans, mix with them, study their local and other

problems and try to solve them to their satisfaction. The workers should live like the
Harijans “so that they can feel that you are one of them”.
Gandhiji emphasized the need for more intensive work for the uplift of
Harijans and called for more workers. It was a very vast work and needed great
patience, energy, time and money, he said.

I do not infer from your letter that you are writing about my
‘Hindus’. Whatever you have in your heart has not come in your
writing. But do not worry about it. When we meet next we will talk
over it if you so desire. Whatever you want to say about the communal
problem should not be said without consulting the Working
Committee. I am also of the opinion that it would be better to be
quiet. The party can give its opinion after consultation with you. They
have a right to do so. Besides it is their duty. I differ from your
opinion. I can not say if I attach importance to the words ‘Hindu’ and
‘Mussalman’. Whatever the Congress does is a different thing. At one
time I do not like ‘Hindu’ and at another time I do not like
‘Mussalman’. It means there cannot be either. All this needs
pondering over. I do not feel the urge for doing anything early2

that members of other communities will be barred. All this needs careful pondering

CHI. VINOBA,

I do not believe that agriculture alone will bring self-reliance.
We should become self-reliant through the handicrafts we take up. I
grant that in the very first year we cannot become self-reliant.
However, when we complete the entire process the expenditure and the
income should balance. I would not call agriculture a handicraft. But
it is an occupation of crores of people. It does not encourage skill but
it does give a lot of physical exercise. It has been accorded its rightful
place after seven years. It is a sad thing that we have been divided into
two groups but that is inevitable. We regard constructive work as a
symbol of ahimsa while others look upon it as a means of furthering
their work. And that only to the extent that if they can do without
itthey will do so. Even if the intention is good I find lack of wisdom in
such an attitude.

WARDHA ,

August 15, 1945
BHAI RAJENDRA BABU,

I have your letter. I am sending your letters to Agatha Harrison
and Krishna Menon, by air mail. I see from these that all those
sentenced to death are classed as political prisoners. Can this view
sustain? During the upheaval a few criminals indulged in foul deeds.
Can they be described as political? Then what the Huns did in Sind
should similarly be described as political. All these things are
weighing on my mind. Even so I do not hold back your letter,
because I have not been given any choice and it is addressed to
Agatha Harrison. The second letter you have forgotten to sign.
However, I am forwarding it to Krishna Menon. The truth is that
capital punishment is bad in itself and it should be abolished.
I have no hope of anything good coming out of it. We must
understand the system. The Viceroy wields supreme power. So if we
are not able to achieve anything here we might as well wash our hands
of the whole thing. They cannot run the administration in any other
way. We should therefore do whatever is possible only here. Our last
resort is public opinion. Public opinion, in this matter, is evidently not
able to do much and when it does achieve something it is not as
effective as it should be. I have stated what can be done about
Mahendra Chowdhary after the execution.1 I hope you have
gonethrough my statement and will have it implemented in whatever
way you can. Something will come of it if competent lawyers take the

Kan-aiyo. They all agree with me. Jajuji has even written down his
view. I send it with this. He has described his own experience. I am
confident that a person like you is bound to have the same
experience. “Swaraj will be gained through yarn,” I said, relying on
intuition. But I realize now that intuition is one thing and its
confirmation by experience another. And what I have been putting
forward now is something different still. Others are having more
convincing experience of the same. It is not going to impress me at all
even if in Kathiawar khadi worth Rs. 4 lakhs instead of Rs. 2 lakhs is
produced and sold. For it could be proved that such production and
sale of khadi would only promote the welfare of the poor, and an
all-India institution like the Charkha Sangh need not be established
merely for that purpose. A co-operative of the poor for producing
khadi could be established and more khadi at still lower cost could be
produced. But even then that khadi would be of value only as khadi
for the poor. It would, one may say, make no contribution to the
cause of swaraj. I, therefore, desire that you should have perfect
self-confidence and adopt this new method—policy—for khadi and
discover from experience that it is khadi for swaraj. It is quite possible
that Kathiawar may not accept such khadi. If so, don’t mind if no
khadi work is done there, for you must be aware that no such work is
done in many Indian States. In the same way if no work is done in
Kathiawar, either, the cause of khadi for swaraj would not suffer. I go
even further and say that in carrying on khadi activity for swaraj, if it
ceases to be khadi for the poor, the latter are not going to lose
anything for they will be able to earn their bread in some other way.
But if khadi supports the poor even while remaining khadi for the
swaraj, it would be a credit both to the poor and the cause of swaraj.
The poor thereby would have contributed to the winning of swaraj. If
I have left any point unexplained, Kanaiyo will explain it when he
arrives there.
I hope your health is perfect. If you can leave that place, it
might be better for you to come and see me once.

August 16, 1945
BHAI LAKSHMI BABU,

We cannot accept even one of the three conditions.1 Even
though we believe that it is an inflammatory speech, constructive
activity has no relation at all with movements such as that of 1942.
Even if we denounce the violent activities of Shri Jayaprakash
Narayan, we cannot accept any of these three conditions, that is to say,
we cannot compel the workers to respect them. If the independence of
India is common cause between us and the Government then what is
the meaning of all these differences?
The truth is that the Bihar Government has made a mistake in
making the arrests but instead of acknowledging the mistake it wants
to put the responsibility on us. We will not accept the responsibility
even if they should wipe us out. Let them stop our peaceful activities.
We shall still go forward.

I have met Labanya Kumar and have written about the
engineers. He has also seen things here.
Now about my visit. I have said I will go. I have also been told
by the Governor that the way is open for my visit. The question now is
when I should go. I cannot go before October under any
circumstances and as regards October you frighten me. I personally
am not frightened but if I am not to go in October it will be very late.

The addressee had written that the Governor of Bihar in his talk with
Anugraha Narayan Sinha had said that:
(i) The Government would not allow the constructive workers to make any
inflammatory speeches. (ii) The Government would not give any opportunity to the
Constructive workers to launch a mass movement as that of 1942. (iii) The
Government would keep a close watch on the activities of the Congress as none of its
members, including Gandhiji, denounced the violent activities of Jayaprakash
Narayan.

So write to me after considering everything. As you must be aware, I
have stayed in Calcutta in October and have moved about. Besides, I
ask myself why I cannot stay in a place where you all can. I will advise
you to see Satis Babu also in this connection. I know it is a tricky
matter, but we should be able to do something.
In Calcutta I shall stay in Sodepur. I know Sarat Babu 1 would
insist that I should stay with him. You should jointly decide and let me
know. I am not going there for a fixed period. I want to lose myself in
the misery of Bengal. I want to go to Midnapore and also to
Chittagong. I do not know how far the body will carry. Also I shall
not be able to put up with undisciplined crowds and constant noise.
Do not go on saying ‘yes’ to everybody. Meet the persons
whom you have to meet and let me know. Meet Sudhir Ghosh also. I
have come to know him quite well and he has something to do with
my going there. He works with the Tatas.

Nevertheless I attach great value to a promise and, therefore, for the
sake of the promise, this knowledge notwithstanding, I will get them
married. However, I do realize from this case that one should make no
promises. But this is like inquiring about a man’s caste after drinking
water at his place. But do we not have the other saying, too, that it is
morning whenever one wakes up?

635. LETTER TO DR. A. G. TENDULKAR
August 18, 1945
DEAR TENDULKAR,

Many are protesting to me that I am officiating at your marriage
tomorrow. Among them are Manilal and now his wife. She tells me
that this will be your third marriage, though I believe in one man one
wife and vice versa for all time. I know about your new German wife
but nothing about your previous wife. My son says none of my ideals
will be realized in this union and that neither you nor Indu will carry
out my wish that you may not procreate during the country’s
dependence. I have told them that I cannot go back on my promise
which is not in itself immoral or not for a manifestly immoralpurpose.
Therefore the promise shall be fulfilled (D. V.,). But you will please
give me such answer as you can.
Now for your preparation for tomorrow:
(1) Both should fast till the marriage tie is formed, fruits may be
taken.
(2) You will both read 12th Chapter of Gita and contemplate its
meaning.
(3) Each will clean up separate plots of ground with measure.
(4) Each will tend cows in the Goshala.
(5) Each will clean up the well side.
(6) Each will clean a closet well.
(7) Each will spin daily and do all these with the intention so far as
possible of carrying out these yajnas daily.

636. YARN DONATION
We all know that Shri Narandas Gandhi is a dedicated votary of
khadi. He has such great faith in khadi that he sees Daridranarayana
in it. He therefore spins for many hours a day. He has also given a
prominent place to spinning in the national school conducted by him
at Rajkot. For the last many years he has been collecting both yarn
and money for the “Charkha Dwadashi’’ 1 . This time he has carried
1

374

Gandhiji’s birthday according to the Vikram calendar

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

the sutra yajna a long way and he has expressed his wish to the
country that not only spinning but donating of yarn should catch on.
Everyone can participate in it. It should be borne in mind that he does
not insist that the yarn should be donated to him only. It can be given
to All-India Spinners’ Association as well. What he wants is that
people should now give yarn donations freely and that he should be
supplied with figures as to the quantity of yarn spun all over India and
the quantity of yarn donated. To provide information to the public it
is enough if these figures are sent to the All-India Spinners’ Association office. However, the activity will gain impetus if figures are
sent to the person who has conceived the idea, has struggled for it and
has fostered the activity. If the figures are sent to him, he will have a
clear picture of the work done and his planning and knowledge will
prove very useful to all for further progress of work.
Every year he seeks my consent for whatever work he does. This
year I thought it proper to accept only yarn donations and suggested
it to him accordingly. I have visualized yarn currency and have called
Chi. Narandas its banker. I believe that he has the right ability and
purity for that kind of work. It is possible that at present the yarn will
not fulfil all the requirements of the currency. But our aim today is to
increase the number of spinners from the standpoint of non-violent
swaraj.
An experiment to make yarn a currency was made locally at
Nalwadi. Another experiment is going on in Bezwada. However the
ideas behind the two experiments were different. The experiment can
be extended to cover the whole of India. Only one year will be
required for such currency to come into force. Every home will then
become a mint. But it is only an idea today. For the time being all the
spinners will produce currency in the form of yarn and will give that
away in donation. Every branch of the All-India Spinners’ Association will collect such donations. The yarn will belong to the All-India
Spinners’ Association. Only the account will be sent to Chi. Narandas.
The ownership will be that of the All-India Spinners’ Association.
Narandas will be the custodian of the yarn sent to him directly or
collected by himself. It will be utilized and distributed with my permission. The money and the yarn collected by Chi. Narandas every year
is distributed with my permission. It will be the same this year also.
This year the idea of cash collection has been given up.
However, cash will be received from those who want to give it but the

VOL. 87 : 29 MAY, 1945 - 29 AUGUST, 1945

375

All-India Spinner’s Association will not make any arrangement for its
collection. The same rule applies to Chi. Narandas. The aim will be to
collect only yarn donations.
Whatever yarn the All-India Spinners’ Association collects will
be its capital. From now on it will not collect cash for carrying on its
activities but will manage with yarn only.
The yarn thus collected will not be sold. But the khadi made
from it will be sold. Yarn will be taken but not given. Only the things
made from it will be given and sold.
The rule already exists of taking a certain amount of yarn when
selling khadi but at some places the practice has been started of giving
khadi in exchange for the full quantity of yarn. In spite of that the
effort will be to have only yarn donations on the occasion ofCharkha
Jayanti. However, I want that besides khadi other articles of village
industries should be made available in exchange for yarn. But that can
be realized only when we take the final step. At the moment I have
presented the idea of yarn currency only in its initial form. It is easy
for accounting and the capital of yarn increases not by interest but by
the labour of the spinner. If the people understand this scheme then
yarn will become an instrument for the production of goods worth
crores of rupees. Physical labour will become the capital and will
easily be able to compete with capitalists.

637. LETTER TO VINOBA BHAVE1
S EVAGRAM ,

August 18, 1945
CHI. VINOBA,

. . . I shall look into the Nayee Talim matter. Ashadevi is not
here at present.
I have not a full copy of the Ramayana as abridged by me but I
send you a marked copy of the Ramayana from which you will be
able to know the principles on which I had worked. As far as possible
I have tried to retain the historical or narrative portion unbroken.
Some of the interpolations are useful by themselves, but still I have
dropped them altogether. I have also dropped any matter which had
been over-lengthened as also such portions as appeared to me
unnecessary for the narrative. I have also generally removed portions
where woman is referred to in derogatory terms. But I have kept some
portions of it just to indicate the mind of Tulsidas. So far as I can
remember at the moment, these are the principles I worked upon. But
you are intelligent enough to discover any other principle not
mentioned here from the marks in the book.
Failure has compelled me to do what I was not prepared to do
by persuasion. I mean that I have commenced from yesterday
therecitation of Gitai 2 in place of the Sanskrit Gita. I realized that
nobody learnt Sanskrit. The same old members are there, but even
they do not or are unable to study Sanskrit even to the extent of
understanding the Gita. Moreover, they were unable to recite it in
chorus, and what pained me more was the fact that though the
recitation of the whole of the Gita was confined to the morning
prayer, still some members walked out as soon as the recitation began.
On making an enquiry into the cause of this, I found that it was very
trivial. I did not know it before. I found it out only the day before
yesterday, and I immediately came to the conclusion that perhaps
interest in the Gita might be created more quickly if it was recited in
Hindi, Marathi or Gujarati since the people would understand its

portion of it as not being “absolutely relevant to the present discussion”. The
original letter in Gujarati is not available.

Mother’.

VOL. 87 : 29 MAY, 1945 - 29 AUGUST, 1945

meaning more easily. I have commenced with Gitai because Marathi
holds the place of prominence in this part. So far as the members
attending the morning prayer are concerned, they are so few that it
would not matter much which language I chose. But the music of
Gitai has been felt by me to be very sweet. Maybe, the reason for this
is that I have heard it several times recited by Shivaji1 and I have liked
it. Kishorelal’s (Gujarati) translation is there but I have not yet been
able to assimilate its music. I have not heard anyone reciting it in a
sweet tone. I got an opportunity of hearing it at Bardoli but it was
insufficient, and my ear could not adapt itself to it. Haribhau2 has
published the Hindi Gita recently. But I have not yet been able even
to examine it and so did not like to touch it. Therefore, I have
commenced with Gitai.
The immediate cause for writing this is that I happened to see
Shivaji yesterday. If he is going to stay here for some time, it would
please me if he can be induced to give at least a week to the Ashram
just now during the period of the commencement of this recitation.
He can train those who desire in reciting it in the same manner as he
does, and pick up his music.

CHI. MUNNALAL,

1. Kanchan does desire sexual pleasure. You also have the
desire. It would not be anything strange if you lived together and
satisfied your desire. Self-suppression is not going to help. Hence do
what you feel is natural for you. Thwarting Kanchan’s desire will
harm her. She is good and has the spirit of service. She will lose both
these things in the end.
2. Let Hiramani go on as she is doing till Ashadevi arrives.
3. Read Parnerkar’s letter and have a talk with him. About the
farm, too, do what is necessary. Take Kishorelal’s help.
4. About Krishnachandra you will have to think. Talk with him
frankly and with love regarding his habit of eating and about other
matters, too. You should think about your temperamental differences.
5. Let the yarn spun by me be handed over to the Ashram. Get
that much quantity spun by me when I arrive there. If the other
people spin from the Ashram cotton, the yarn should be credited to
the Ashram. What we spin is of course for the Ashram.
6. Whenever you wish to ask me anything about the women, you
may do so.
7. You will be able to improve your singing with effort. If you
have no time for that, you need not join in the singing at all.
8. Run classes for the Gitai and nothing else.
9. About the expenses here, it is all right that you have bought
the ticket. I will not be able to judge better in this matter.
10. Sankaranji may, if he wishes, cook his own meals if he
cannot keep good health otherwise.
11. Ramachandran is there only for a short period.
12. The library books can be kept together. Those who want
books may ask for them and afterwards return them in good
condition.

646. HOW TO DO IT?
The A. I. V. I. A. has not shown the results it might have. I have
often asked myself that question. I try now and here to think aloud
and confer with the workers to see what can be done.
We lazily copy the Congress and set up committees and think
that we shall thereby popularize and advance the craft of the villages.
We forget that the Congress, being a democratic body, must
work democratically and through committees set up by the people
from [among] themselves. On the other hand, the A.I.V.I.A. and like
bodies are self-formed to work out particular purposes often requiring
high technical skill. They collect money from those who appreciate
the particular purpose and become trustees for the money to be used
therefor. We collect and study the literature on the subject. We look
about for and employ experts and if there are none become experts
ourselves. The work will make progress in exact proportion to our
knowledge, earnestness and industry. The work itself may be
unpopular or unknown. We have then to make it popular or known.
Such associations all over the world must work whether in countries
democratically or autocratically governed. In either case they must
work under patronage or in the teeth of opposition. The system of
work will be identical under either autocracy or democracy. With us
the A. I. S. A., the A. I. V. I. A., the Hindustani Talimi Sangh, etc.,
though autonomous, are creations of the Congress and, therefore
requiring enthusiastic support of all Congressmen and, to the extent
that Congressmen represent all India, of Indians throughout the land.
But before this can happen we must dot India with experts of the type
wanted. Therefore, the first thing is to have a central body of honest
experts. There is no other royal road to success. Committees or even
agents can show no results unless they are experts who know their

382

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

work. Can an M.A., however brilliant he may be, introduce, say, the
charkha among the villagers, or gur-making from palm trees or
manure-making from village refuse including human excreta and
cattle dung? We must have experts in these and such other branches.
If we had our own government, however inefficient, we would have
technical institutes where every one of the useful activities now going
on or which were going on even yesterday in the 7,00,000 villages
could be studied. Unfortunately, we have not. Hence our associations
have also to be such institutes in addition to becoming propagandists.
But before we can become the latter, we have to become the former. If
I have drawn a correct picture, let us mend even though the mending
may be difficult and even hurtful to our pride.

647. FOREWORD TO “THE ECONOMY OF PERMANENCE”
Like his brochure on the Practice and Precepts of Jesus, Dr.
Kumarappa’s on The Economy of Permanence is a jail production. It
is not as easy to understand as the first. It needs careful reading twice
or thrice if it is to be fully appreciated. When I took up the manuscript
I was curious to know what it could contain. The opening chapter
satisfied my curiosity and led me on to the end without fatigue and
yet with profit. This doctor of our village industries shows that only
through them we shall arrive at the economy of permanence in the
place of that of the fleeting nature we see around us at present. He
tackles the question—shall the body triumph over and stifle the soul
or shall the latter triumph over and express itself through a perishable
body which, with its few wants healthily satisfied, will be free to
subserve the end of the imperishable soul? This is “Plain living and
high thinking”.

BAPA,

It seems your letter has got lost in my papers. All of a sudden I
remembered what it contained, though I cannot recall the whole letter.
You are not to work as a clerk at all. That is why I sent the message
that I would send Valjibhai’s son. However, that is an old story. Do
employ a clerk of your choice and devote the time you save to more
important work. I very much like the idea of introducing Hindustani
in the office and in the books. Let those who want English go on

demanding it. If we cannot or do not introduce such reforms, we shall
be betraying the country as well as the Harijans.
There was one thing in my mind which I forgot. Shyamlal on
his own has reduced his salary by Rs. 100. I like the decision but what
is surprising about it? I have thanked him for it. 1 But I wanted to
inform the general body and thank him at the meeting. However, I
could not do that, but you may, as Secretary of the organization,
inform the members and add that the President had thanked him as
soon as he got the news; that he wanted to announce it at the
meetingbut forgot; and that he had therefore written to you to inform
everyone. Write something on these lines.

Let me know if it is not so. Have this read out to you. Do something

become an ideal goshala. Keep the place perfectly clean. Our water
should be drinkable. Mosquitoes and flies should easily go. The roads
should be in good condition. The hill is in our possession. Those who
go for walks there should bring stones from there. Do you know that
in this way I had made a mountain of stones in the Mahila Ashram?

I have gone through the English part of what you have sent.
Why did you have to write in English? Hindustani would have been
sufficient. The English needs improvement. You must leave that to
others. I shall try to read the Hindustani also. I shall read the scheme
of Goseva Sangh also before getting it published. Show it to Parnerkar
and Satis Babu and, if possible, to a veterinarian. I had a few pages
read out to me by Sushilabehn. She has pointed out some technical
mistakes. The treatment of the subject matter is good. You have said
in brief all that you could say. If I want to return it shall I send it to
Ahmedabad? I understand that you have not kept a copy.
You suggest boycotting the buffalo. This you will not have got
from my writings. My view is that our preference should be for the
Cow.Doing this will save both. At present there is shortage of milk, so
We need both. Preferring the cow saves both, preferring the buffalo
destroys both.

Your half angry and half loving letter. Why are you so foolish
as to take in what a third party says? Kasturba2 is a wholly
non-sectarian organization. Who was the third party who gave you to
understand that only Hindus could apply? The thing has to come
before me. It has not yet. If you have applied send me a copy of the
application too. You know that Aryanayakum is a Christian? Raihana
Tyabji is a trustee. So much for the Trust.
When there is independence, why should you fear the majority?
If you have God with you and the majority have not, should you still
fear? And if both have God between them who should fear whom? Is
there then any question of majority and minority?
Let us pray.

702. LETTER TO KISHORELAL G. MASHRUWALA
August 27, 1945
CHI. KISHORELAL,

I have your letter. The weather is still moist. The house is near
the mill and it is possible to find something there. But I do not have
the courage to call you here till the weather completely clears. We do
not want to fall out of the frying pan into the fire. Still I will call you
when it completely stops raining here and that too in the hope that the
change of air will do good to both of you. I do not want to take work
from you here. Valji comes daily. His competent son is also prepared
to render some service but I have not entrusted him with any work.
There is no work which can be given to him.
I understand about Parnerkar.
You have done what you could. It seems that your recommendations cannot be implemented now. Everyone has land and a
house, how can they be removed? Moreover, can those who are true
workers stay at a distance? Why should they be servants? It is a
matter of shame and sorrow that they are retained as servants.
Thenumber of those who are retained as servants will not be reduced
by their staying in different places. Only the attitude of everyone
should be changed. If that happens the question of staying separately
or in different places should not arise. Yes, one thing is certain. It will

VOL. 87 : 29 MAY, 1945 - 29 AUGUST, 1945

409

be a long time before people’s nature changes. In the mean time there
will be a scramble for servants and that will do good to no one.
However, if I have understood your recommendations they may be
applied in future but not to the organizations which are functioning
today. There was and is a purpose in merging all the organizations,
although whatever has happened was only a drifting of the current.
Do let me know if there is a flaw in the argument. If the present
situation cannot be changed I want to understand the whole position.
I hope both of you are keeping good health.
Blessings from

[On or before August 29, 1945] 2
In spite of my disinclination to answer the question like the one
put to me by Mr. Emanuel Celler, I feel that I shall be wanting in
courtesy, if I do not meet Mr. Celler’s wishes. The best way for
America to assist India’s struggle for independence is to study the
question, so as not to be misled by the untruth that is being spread by
British Agency at a great cost about India. Americans have to get out
of the way of her struggle. For the rest, India has to fight her own
battle of independence which she is trying to secure by a non-violent
technique.
The Bombay Chronicle, 30-8-1945

This was conveyed to Emanuel Celler, member of the United States House of
Representatives, through D. F. Karaka, special correspondent of The Bombay
Chronicle in New York. Emanuel Celler had asked how “we in the United States can
aid in hastening the attainment of India’s independence”.

Ashram are together because they were all conceived by one man—
other two exist separately merely by chance. They could both
havebeen located at one place. As far as the site is concerned the
Ashram and the Goshala should coexist. This has to be thought over. I
have liked your letter and so sent it to the Ashram. Do think over the
matter if you can. But if it is not possible leave it. It can’t be solved by
devoting more time to it. We must know the subject is beyond our ken

LETTER FROM JAIRAMDAS DAULATRAM TO ANAND T. HINGORANI 1
PANCHGANI,
June 10, 1945
DEAR BROTHER,

You must have received my letter sent from here. Your letter of the 3rd June
addressed to Bapu was received by him today. There is a great pressure of work on
him, so he has asked me to reply to it.
Bapu said that he had also received your earlier letter, but owing to rush of
work he could not send a reply. After coming here I am better able to realize what a
tremendous burden of work rests on him and how he can deal with it only bit by bit on
account of his reduced capacity. There is no quick disposal of work as before. Besides,
the present happenings in the country also take up much of his time.
About the “Daily Thoughts”, Bapu inquired whether they would be published in
Hindi only or there would also be English rendering simultaneously.If there is to be
an English translation, then he will like to see it himself and this task he will not be
able to shoulder at present. I do not exactly remember what we had decided about the
English translation. So please write to me by return of post. If it is only the Hindi
edition, then there will be no difficulty in Bapu’s writing a preface to it. Perhaps it
would be easier for him to find time for it.
As regards the questions you had sent to Bapu in respect of your book “To the
Statesmen of the World”, Bapu says that he would have gladly answered them, but that
at the present moment his mind is not disposed to undertake that burden either. You
will, therefore, have to do without his answer to your questions.
I had spoken to Bapu regarding the Navajivan and the “Gandhi Series”. He
advised me that since Naraharibhai was here, I should personally hear what he has to
say. I had, therefore, a brief talk with him last evening and will have further
discussion with him again today. Then we shall see where the matter stands.
Have you got enough supply of paper for bringing out your new book “To the
Statesmen”? I learn that the Government is increasing the paper quota. How far is it

APPENDIX II
SPEECH BROADCAST BY THE VICEROY 1
June 14, 1945
I have been authorized by His Majesty’s Government to place before Indian
political leaders proposals designed to ease the present political situation and to
advance India towards her goal of full self-government. These proposals are at the
present moment being explained to Parliament by the Secretary of State for India. My
intention in this broadcast is to explain to you the proposals, the ideas underlying
them, and the method by which I hope to put them into effect.
This is not an attempt to obtain or impose a constitutional settlement. His
Majesty’s Government had hoped that the leaders of the Indian parties would agree
amongst themselves on a settlement of the communal issue, which is the main
stumbling-block; but this hope has not been fulfilled.
In the mean time, India has great opportunities to be taken and great problems
to be solved, which require a common effort by the leading men of all parties. I,
therefore, propose, with the full support of His Majesty’s Government, to invite
Indian leaders, both of Central and Provincial politics, to take counsel with me with a
view to the formation of a new Executive Council more representative of organized
political opinion. The proposed new Council would represent the main communities
and would include equal proportions of caste Hindus and Muslims. It would work, if
formed, under the existing Constitution. But it would be an entirely Indian Council,
except for the Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief, who would retain his position as
War Member. It is also proposed that the portfolio of External Affairs, which has
hitherto been held by the Viceroy, should be placed in charge of an Indian Member of
Council, so far as the interests of British India are concerned.
A further step proposed by His Majesty’s Government is the appointment of a

THE COLLETED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

British High Commissioner in India, as in the Dominions, to represent Great
Britains’ commercial and other such interests in India.
Such a new Executive Council will, you realize, represent a definite advance on
the road to self-government. It will be almost entirely Indian, and the Finance and
Home Members will for the first time be Indians, while an Indian will also be charged
with the management of India’s Foreign Affairs. Moreover, Members will now be
selected by the Governor-General after consultations with political leaders; though
their appointment will of course be subject to the approval of His Majesty the
King-Emperor.
The council will work within the framework of the present constitution and
there can be no question of the Governor-General agreeing not to exercise his
constitutional power of control; but it will of course not be exercised unreasonably.
I should make it clear that the formation of this interim Government will in no way
prejudice the final constitutional settlement.
The main task for this new Executive Council would be:
First, to prosecute the war against Japan with the utmost energy till Japan is
utterly defeated.
Secondly, to carry on the Government of British India, with all the manifold
tasks of post-war development in front of it, until a new permanent constitution can
be agreed upon and come into force.
Thirdly, to consider, when the Members of the Government think it possible,
the means by which such agreement can be achieved. The third task is most
important. I want to make it quite clear that neither I nor His Majesty’s Government
have lost sight of the need for a long-term solution, and that the present proposals
are intended to make a long-term solution easier.
I have considered the best means of forming such a Council; and have decided
to invite the following to Viceregal Lodge to advise me:
Those now holding office as Premier in a Provincial Government; or, for
provinces now under Section 93 Government, those who last held the office of the
Premier.
The Leader of the Congress Party and the Deputy Leader of the Muslim League
in the Central Assembly; the leader of the Congress Party and the Muslim League in
the Council of State; also the leader of the Nationalist Party and the European Group
in the Assembly.
Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Jinnah as the recognized leaders of the two main political
parties.
Rao Bahadur N. Siva Raj to represent the Scheduled Classes.
Master Tara Singh to represent the Sikhs.

VOL. 87 : 29 MAY, 1945 - 29 AUGUST, 1945

427

Invitations to these gentlemen are being handed to them today and it is
proposed to assemble the conference on 25th June at Simla where we shall be cooler
than at Delhi.
I trust that all those invited will attend the conference and give me their help.
On me and on them will lie a heavy responsibility in this fresh attempt to make
progress towards a final settlement of India’s future.
If the meeting is successful, I hope that we shall be able to agree on the
formation of the new Executive Council at the Centre. I also hope that it will be
possible for Ministries to re-assume office and again undertake the tasks of
Government in the provinces now administered under Section 93 of the Constitution
Act and that these Ministries will be coalitions.
If the meeting should unfortunately fail, we must carry on as at present until
the parties are ready to come together. The existing Executive Council, which has
done such valuable work for India will continue it if other arrangements cannot be
agreed.
But I have every hope that the meeting will succeed, if the party leaders will
approach the problem with the sincere intention of working with me and with each
other. I can assure them that there is behind this proposal a most genuine desire on
the part of all responsible leaders in the United Kingdom and of the British people as
a whole to help India towards her goal. I believe that this is more than a step towards
that goal, it is a considerable stride forward, and a stride on the right path.
I should make it clear that these proposals affect British India only
and do not make any alteration in the relations of the Princes with the Crown
Representative.
With the approval of His Majesty’s Government, and after consultation with
my Council, orders have been given for the immediate release of the members of the
Working Committee of Congress who are still in detention. I propose to leave the
final decision about the others still under detention as the result of the 1942
disturbances to the new Central Government, if formed, and to the Provincial
governments.
The appropriate time for fresh elections for the Central and Provincial
legislatures will be discussed at the conference.
Finally, I would ask you all to help in creating the atmosphere of goodwill and
mutual confidence that is essential if we are to make progress. The destiny of this
great country and of the many millions who live in it depends on the wisdom and
good understanding of the leaders, both of action and of thought, British and Indian,
at this critical moment of India’s history.
India’s military reputation never stood higher in the world than it does at
present; thanks to the exploits of her sons drawn from all parts of the country. Her
representatives at international conference have won high regard for their

428

statesmanlike attitude. Sympathy for India’s aspirations and progress towards
prosperity was never greater or more widespread. We have thus great assets if we can
use them wisely. But it will not be easy, it will not be quick; there is very much to do,
there are many pitfalls and dangers. There is on all sides something to forgive and
forget.
I believe in the future of India, and as far as in me lies will further her
greatness. I ask you all for your co-operation and goodwill.

TELEGRAM FROM LORD WAVELL 1
Immediate

NEW DELHI,

June 16, 1945
M. K. GANDHI ESQ.
PANCHGANI
Many thanks for your telegram of 15th June. I have also seen your
statement in today’s newspapers. As regards your attendance at the conference
I will await your letter referred to in your telegram of 16th June which I
have just received. I assure you, term “caste Hindus” was not used with
offensiveintention. Meaning is that there should be equality between Muslims and
Hindus other than members of scheduled castes. Subject to this, exact composition of
council would of course have to be decided after discussion at conference. On question
of independence I invite your attention to Secretary of State’s speech in Parliament
on 14th June as published in Indian Press. Following is the relevant passage:
The offer of March 1942 stands in its entirety. That offer is based on two main
principles. First, no limit is set to India’s freedom to decide her own destiny whether
as a free partner in the Commonwealth or even without it. Second, that this can only
be achieved under a constitution or constitutions framed by Indians to which the main
elements are consenting parties.
It would not be practicable to modify the terms of my broadcast. It is only a
simple statement of the proposals approved by His Majesty’s Government and my
intention is to deal at the conference itself with any points requiring clarification. I
do not think it advisable to enter into detailed discussions before the conference
which I hope, as you do yourself, will be held in a friendly atmosphere and without
party bitterness. As you suggest I am releasing our telegrams to the Press.

APPENDIX IV
DESAI-LIAQAT PACT1
The Congress and the League agree that they will join in forming an interim
government in the Centre. The composition of such Government will be on the
following lines:
(a) An equal number of persons nominated by the Congress and the League in
the Central Executive (the persons nominated need not be members of the Central
Legislature),
(b)
Sikhs),
(c)

representatives of minorities (in particular the Scheduled Castes and the
the Commander-in-Chief.

The Government will be formed and will function within the framework of the
existing Government of India Act. It is, however, understood that, if the Cabinet
cannot get a particular measure passed by the Legislative Assembly, they will not
enforce the same by resort to any of the reserve powers of the Governor-General or
the Viceroy. This will make them sufficiently independent of the Governor-General.
It is agreed between the Congress and the League that, if such interim
government is formed, their first step would be to release the Working Committee
members of the Congress.
The steps by which efforts would be made to achieve this end are at present
indicated to take the following course:
On the basis of the above understanding some way should he found to get the
Governor-General to make a proposal or a suggestion that he desires an interim
Government to be formed in the Centre on the agreement between the Congress and
the League and when the Governor-General invites Mr. Jinnah and Mr. Desai either
jointly or separately, the above proposal would be made declaring that they are
prepared to join in forming the government.
The next step would be to get the withdrawal of Section 93 in the Provinces
and to form as soon as possible Provincial Governments on the lines of a coalition.

APPENDIX VI
STATEMENT MADE IN PARLIAMENT BY SECRETARY OF
STATE FOR INDIA 1
June 14, 1945
During the recent visit of Field-Marshal Viscount Wavell to this country, His
Majesty’s Government reviewed with him a number of problems and discussed
particularly the present political situation in India.
Members will be aware that since the offer by His Majesty’s Government to
India of March 1942, there has been no further progress towards the solution of the
Indian constitutional problem.
As was then stated, the working out of India’s new constitutional system is a
task which can only be carried through by the Indian people themselves.
While His Majesty’s Government are at all times most anxious to do their
utmost to assist the Indians in the working out of a new constitutional settlement, it
would be a contradiction in terms to speak of the imposition by this country of
self-governing institutions upon an unwilling India. Such a thing is not possible,
nor could we accept the responsibility for enforcing such institutions at the very time
when we were, by its purpose, withdrawing from all control of British Indian affairs.
The main constitutional position remains therefore as it was. The offer of
March 1942 stands in its entirety without change or qualification. His Majesty’s
Government still hope that the political leaders in India may be able to come to an
agreement as to the procedure whereby India’s permanent future form of government
can be determined.
His Majesty’s Government are, however, most anxious to make any
contribution that is practicable to the breaking of the political deadlock in India.
While that deadlock lasts not only political but social and economic progress is
being hampered.
The Indian administration, over-burdened with the great tasks laid upon it by
the war against Japan and by the planning for the post-war period, is further strained
by the political tension that exists.
All that is so urgently required to be done for agricultural development
and for the peasants and workers of India cannot be carried through unless
whole-hearted co-operation of every community and section of the Indian people is
forthcoming.
His Majesty’s Government have therefore considered whether there is
1

432

Vide “Interview to The Press”, 18-6-1945.

THE COLLETED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

something which they could suggest in this interim period, under the existing
constitution, pending the formulation by Indians of their future constitutional
arrangements which would enable the main communities and parties to co-operate
more closely together and with the British to the benefit of the people of India as a
whole.
It is not the intention of His Majesty’s Government to introduce any change
contrary to the wishes of the major Indian communities. But they are willing to make
possible some steps forward during the interim period if the leaders of the principal
Indian parties are prepared to agree to their suggestion and to co-operate in the
successful conclusion of the war against Japan as well as in the reconstruction in
India which must follow the final victory.
To this end they would be prepared to see an important change in the
composition of the Viceroy’s Executive. This is possible without making any change
in the existing statute law except for one amendment to the Ninth Schedule to the Act
of 1935. That Schedule contains a provision that not less than three members of the
Executive must have had at least 10 years’ service under the Crown in India. If the
proposals I am about to lay before the House meet with acceptance in India, that
clause would have to be amended to dispense with that requirement.
It is proposed that the Executive Council should be reconstituted and that the
Viceroy should in future make his selection to the Crown for appointment to his
Executive from amongst leaders of Indian political life at the Centre and in the
Provinces, in proportions which would give a balanced representation of the main
communities, including equal proportions of Muslims and caste Hindus.
In order to pursue this object, the Viceroy will call into conference a
number of leading Indian politicians who are the heads of the most important parties
or who have had recent experience as Prime Ministers of Provinces, together with a
few others of special experience and authority. The Viceroy intends to put before this
conference the proposal that the Executive Council should be reconstituted as above
stated and to invite from the members of the conference a list of names. Out of these
he would hope to be able to choose the future members whom he would recommend for
appointment by his Majesty to the Viceroy’s council, although the responsibility for
the recommendations must of course continue to rest with him, and his freedom of
choice therefore remains unrestricted.
The members of his Council who are chosen as a result of this arrangement
would of course accept the position on the basis that they would whole-heartedly
co-operate in supporting and carrying through the war against Japan to its victorious
conclusion.
The members of the Executive would be Indians with the exception of
the Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief, who would retain his position as War

VOL. 87 : 29 MAY, 1945 - 29 AUGUST, 1945

433

Member. This is essential so long as the defence of India remains a British
responsibility.
Nothing contained in any of these proposals will affect the relations of the
Crown with the Indian States through the Viceroy as Crown Representative.
The Viceroy has been authorized by His Majesty’s Government to place this
proposal before the Indian leaders. His Majesty’s Government trust that the leaders of
the Indian communities will respond. For the success of such a plan must depend on
its acceptance in India and the degree to which responsible Indian politicians are
prepared to co-operate with the object of making it a workable interim arrange-ment.
In the absence of such general acceptance existing arrangements must neces-sarily
continue.
If such co-operation can be achieved at the Centre it will no doubt be reflected
in the provinces and so enable responsible governments to be set up once again in
those provinces where, owing to the withdrawal of the majority party from
participation, it became necessary to put into force the powers of the Governors under
Section 93 of the Act of 1935. It is to be hoped that in all the Provinces these
governments would be based on the participation of the main parties, thus smoothing
out communal differences and allowing Ministers to concentrate upon their very
heavy administrative tasks.
There is one further change which, if these proposals are accepted, His
Majesty’s Government suggest should follow.
That is, that External Affairs (other than those tribal and frontier matters
which fall to be dealt with as part of the defence of India) should be placed in the
charge of an Indian Member of the Viceroy’s Executive so far as British India is
concerned, and that fully accredited representatives shall be appointed for the
representation of India abroad.
By their acceptance of and co-operation in this scheme the Indian leaders will
not only be able to make their immediate contribution to the direction of Indian
affairs, but it is also to be hoped that their experience of co-operation in government
will expedite agreement between them as to the method of working out the new
constitutional arrangements.
His Majesty’s Government consider, after the most careful study of the
question, that the plan now suggested gives the utmost progress practicable within
the present constitution. None of the changes suggested will in any way prejudice or
prejudge the essential form of the future permanent constitution or constitutions for
India.
His Majesty’s Government feel certain that given goodwill and a genuine
desire to co-operate on all sides, both British and Indian, these proposals can mark a

434

THE COLLETED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

genuine step forward in the collaboration of the British and Indian peoples towards
Indian self-government and can assert the rightful position, and strengthen the
influence, of India in the counsels of the nations.

APPENDIX VII
LORD WAVELL’S NOTE ON HIS INTERVIEW 1
June 24, 1945
I began by making a short statement on the objects of the proposals of H. M.
G., the spirit in which they were conceived and the spirit in which I hoped they would
be accepted and worked. I emphasized the necessity for full support of the war, and
that it was essential that the political parties should put in their very best men,
determined to concentrate on the economic and other problems of India, and not
merely to enter the Government in a party spirit.
Mr. Gandhi then made a long, tortuous and prolix statement, which dealt with
the history of the Congress, British rule in India, British character, the qualities of a
good soldier, and many other more or less relevant subjects. It lasted over half an
hour, and ended with a sort of general blessing on the proposals, which he said he had
recommended to the Working Committee.
He then went on, referring to some notes, to deal with certain other points. I
think this was a list prepared for him as a result of the discussions by Congress
Working Committee. The main points were as follows:
(a) That it would have been much better if I had ordered the release of all the
political prisoners and not merely the Working Committee.
(b) That the term ‘Caste Hindus’ should not have been used, as his great aim
was that there should be no question of caste inside Congress; he would have preferred
the term ‘Non-Scheduled Hindus’.
(c) He then went on to the question of coalitions in Provinces, obviously with
the idea of trying to establish that the minorities should be represented by members
of their body belonging to Congress.
(d) He referred to the matter of parity, and said he had been under very severe
pressure as regards this, but that he was prepared to accept it. He indicated that it
would be open to Congress to put forward the names of Muslims or Scheduled Castes,
and I agreed but said that the principle of parity between non-Scheduled Hindus and
Muslims must be maintained.
(e) He then digressed into a long story about members of the Indian Army who
1

Vide “Letter to Lord Wavell”, 25-6-1945.

VOL. 87 : 29 MAY, 1945 - 29 AUGUST, 1945

435

had wished to see him but had been compelled, like Nicodemus, to come to him by
night and in mufti. I said that the one thing which was disastrous for any government
was if the army became political; that the Indian Army had a Commander-in-Chief in
whom they had full trust; that their reputation never stood higher and that I could
assure him that the Indian Army was on the whole a thoroughly contented body. He
agreed to all these statements.
(f) He then started on the question of the Indian States. I said that the
conference dealt entirely with British India, and that I was not prepared at this stage
to enter into a discussion of the Indian States. He agreed that it had nothing to do with
the conference and was not appropriate for discussion at the moment.
I asked Mr. Gandhi at the end, whether he proposed to attend the conference in
person. He said that he represented nobody except himself, and that though he would
be prepared to attend the conference if I wished, and sit in a corner, he strongly
advised me that his presence at the conference was undesirable. He said that he would
hold himself at my disposal for as long as I wished, but that if I had nothing on which
I had to consult him he would propose to leave Simla tomorrow. I said that I would let
him know.
The interview was mainly a discursive monologue by Mr. Gandhi, interspersed
by numerous digressions, such as a most graphic description of the death of his
Private Secretary and the relation of his carrying down the wounded General Woodgate
from Spion Kop in 1899. My general impression of him was that he was friendly for
the time being, but perfectly prepared to go back at any time on anything he had said.

APPENDIX VIII
ABUL KALAM AZAD’S LETTER TO LORD WAVELL 1
ARMSDELL, S IMLA,

July 15, 1945
DEAR LORD WAVELL,

After announcing the failure of the Conference, you were good enough to ask
for the support of all parties in ensuring a calm atmosphere. I do not propose to
reiterate the Congress view about the failure. I expressed it sufficiently at the
Conference. But in fairness to you and to ourselves I must point out that co-operation
inevitably depends on the removal of obstacles to it. Some of these obstacles are of a
psychological nature with roots in the past relations between India and England.
These can only gradually disappear with a change in those relations. But there are
others of a more tangible kind which serve as constant irritants to our people and
which affect our day-to-day activity. They are continually before us. In spite of this
preoccupation, however, we did not think it desirable to raise this matter, except
perhaps rather vaguely in the course of conversations with you, as we were anxious
not to place any difficulties in your path when you were dealing with a delicate
situation.
2. But now that one chapter has ended and our minds, as well as yours, are
turned to future possibilities of finding a way out, honourable to all concerned and
leading to the objective of Indian freedom, these obstacles to co-operation cannot be
ignored. I am taking the liberty, therefore, of pointing them out to you in the hope
that you will have early steps taken to have them removed.
3. The steps that I consider necessary and earnestly urge upon you are:
(a) The bans on all Congress and allied organizations should be removed at
once. It has not been possible to convene the A. I. C. C. because of its being an
illegal organization.
(b) All detenus should be released without any condition being imposed upon
them, whether the detention was imposed by the Central Government or the
Provincial Governments.
(c) All restrictions on the movements of released detenus or prisoners should
be removed.
(d) Cases of all prisoners convicted for political or like offences should be
examined by a popular judicial tribunal, its verdict should be regarded as final by the

1

Government.
(e) Extra-legal restrictions on the freedom of the Press or on the movement or
association of people should be removed so as to make the people feel that they are
free to follow normal activities under democratic conditions.
(f) All pending sentences of hanging arising out of the disturbances of August
1942 should be commuted to life sentences.
(g) All pending arrests of ‘absconders’ should be cancelled.
(h) All prisoners who have
unconditionally discharged.

served full fourteen

years

should

be

(i) What has been said above about prisoners applies equally, and with even
greater force, to properties, movable and immovable, and frozen or confiscated.
4. I have not endeavoured to argue out the justness of the foregoing
requirements as I have no doubt that you will yourself appreciate the need for action
along the lines indicated. If India is on the eve of having a bona-fide national
representative Executive, leading to independence after the defeat of Japan, then the
necessity for this approach is self-proved and inevitable.
5. There is another matter to which I should like to refer. I need hardly say on
behalf of the Congress that whatever the result of your promised effort the Congress
is and has always been against the Japanese aggression. Therefore, there will always
be on the part of the Congress a desire for the defeat of Japan in her designs upon
China or any other aggression on her part. But the thought expressed in this
paragraph will be incomplete if I did not inform you that, in the Congress estimation,
the effort now being made on Indian soil will continue to be looked upon as a British
and Allied effort, so long as there is not at the Centre a popular government assisted
by provincial popular governments.
Yours sincerely,
