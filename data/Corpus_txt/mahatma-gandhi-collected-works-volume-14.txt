4. LETTER TO MARSHALL CAMPBELL
110, FIELD S TREET,
DURBAN,

December 26, 1913
2

DEAR MR. MARSHALL CAMPBELL ,

I learnt only two or three days ago that you had returned from
England. Will you allow me to tell you how deeply concerned I was
when I learnt that your men were among the first to strike on the
coast? At an important meeting, when I was actually asked why I
would not advocate a strike on the sugar plantations also, I replied that
we were endeavouring to confine the area to the collieries only, in the
hope that the strike on the collieries would be a sufficient demonstration to secure relief. Whilst I was at Newcastle organizing relief for
the collieries’ men who had come out, I was asked by my co-workers
in Durban what answer to give to the coastal Indians who wanted to
join the movement, and I emphatically told them that the time was not
ripe for them to do so. Later, too, when I was again approached, I
made the same statement and one of my last letters3 before my arrest
was that, as we were so much indebted to you for your efforts to bring
about the repeal of the £3 tax legislation, your men should be the last
to be called out; but I am absolutely certain that after my arrest the
workers found it impossible to control the men and the movement
became not only spontaneous, but it assumed gigantic proportions. I
would like you to enter into our feelings. Had I been free and assisted
in calling out the men, I must freely admit that I would have certainly

endeavoured to call out your men also; but, as I have already stated,
yours would have been the last estate.
As you know, in this struggle for honour and self-respect, and
for the relief of the distress of my dumb and helpless countrymen, the
indentured Indians, it was not possible for us to consider or confine
the extent of our sufferings. In this struggle we have not hesitated
to invite our own women and children to suffer and lose their all,
and we could not very well be expected to consider the interests of
individual friends and sympathisers. In all our strugglesof this nature
the innocent as well as the guilty suffer. I hope, therefore, that neither
my countrymen nor I have forfeited the valuable co-operation
andsympathy which you have always extended. I may state that I am
just now carrying on delicate negotiations with General Smuts, in spite
of his rejection of our prayer, and if you have the leisure and could
interest yourself in the negotiations, and if you would appoint a time
and place, I would come over and discuss the situation.
Both Messrs Kallenbach and Polak, who have pleasant recollections of the luncheon you gave in honour of Mr. Gokhale, associate
themselves in the sentiments I have expressed.1

5. INTERVIEW TO REUTER2
[DURBAN,

Before December 27, 1913]
Mr. Gandhi, interviewed by Reuter on the subject of the reply received
from Government,3 said that there seemed in it a tone of conciliation of which he was
trying to take advantage. He would not state anything beyond saying that he had
placed himself in private communication with the Government, but he thought
that a way out of the deadlock was possible, and that, without any loss of

prestige or dignity, Government could respond to the earnest prayer of the Indian
community for the representation of its interests. The Government’s declaration that
it, at any rate, did not intend the Commission to bear a partisan character was a
hopeful sign.
He added that he wanted to assure the Europeans in South Africa that he felt just
as much for the Europeans as for his own countrymen, regarding the sufferings to be
undergone by them both in a struggle of this gigantic nature; and that, realizing fully
his sense of responsibility, he would leave no stone unturned to avoid a revival of
passive resistance.
He claimed to rank amongst the staunchest loyalists alike to the
ImperialGovernment as to the Union Government and, his loyalty being rather to the
Constitution than to persons, was unaffected by acts of the Government, however
harsh he might consider them to be.
He, therefore, begged the citizens of South Africa to believe him in his
declaration that he would leave nothing, short of compromising his own conscience,
undone to avoid a recrudescence of the sufferings. On his release from imprisonment,
he was deeply pained to learn that employers on the coast, for some of whom he
entertained high regard, had to suffer losses. He only hoped that the Government
would appreciate the private communication which he had made, and that the
European public would lend their support even though it might be on trust.

This was in response to Gokhale’s suggestion contained in a cable dated
27th reading: “Please make no public mention Viceroy moving Lord Crewe secure
adjournment or what you will do if adjournment not granted this to avoid appearance
threat. Confine announcement for the present statement you postpone renewal
struggle pending arrival Robertson and one week after. Say, if necessary, you do this
under strong pressure from India.”
2
Gokhale sent two cables the following day. The first cable was: “Have just
sent following wire Viceroy: ‘Gandhi promises not renew struggle till Sir Benjamin
has had one week there after arrival. I have given Gandhi to understand Sir Benjamin
starts immediately.’ Impossible now Robertson start tomorrow. He must have at least
one day hand over charge after receiving Viceroy’s orders, and another for journey
Nagpur to Bombay.”
The second said: “Viceroy wires: ‘In view promise given by Gandhi and my
intense desire secure peaceful settlement, Robertson will leave first January arriving
Durban about eleventh. Have asked Lord Crewe endeavour arrange with Union
Government short postponement meeting Commission.’ Viceroy wants you
communicate freely with Robertson on arrival. He goes [to] give fullest assistance
community. Viceroy, however, thinks it desirable you should know that if
community resort passive resistance or violence, Robertson will immediately
dissociate himself.” For the full text of the Viceroy’s cable to Gokhale, vide

8. SPEECH AT MARITZBURG2
MARITZBURG,

[December 27, 1913]
Mr. Gandhi, in a speech of noteworthy moderation, intimated that
negotiations of an important character were proceeding in connection with the
grievances of the Indians. Indians had, he said, to await the final issue of the
negotiations. He counselled them to be ready, as it might happen that they would be
called upon to join in the march from Durban to the Transvaal to court arrest. He did
not anticipate that the march would commence on January 1. It might not take place
until January 15. And in the event of such a march taking place, they had to make all
the necessary arrangements for commissariat, which was a matter of very great
importance. He claimed, in the course of his speech, that they were simply seeking to
obtain the elementary rights of humanity and ordinary justice.3

Indian Opinion, 31-12-1913

1

Charles Frere Andrews ( 1871-1940); British missionary who took great
interest in Viswabharati, University founded by Tagore; his devoted services for
many years in the cause of the Indian people, especially those in distress or
difficulty, won him the name “Deenabandhu”, friend of the poor; he was deeply
attached to Gandhiji.
2
Gandhiji spoke at a meeting attended by about 1,000 Indians. This report
was reproduced in Indian Opinion from The Natal Mercury.

Parsee Rustomjee and H. S. L. Polak also addressed the gathering.

communications was covered in a secret despatch of December 31 addressed by the

This was sent in response to the following cable, dated December 28,
from Gokhale: “Necessary now explain country your position. Best course you
cable me immediately for publication compact connected statement four
hundred words or more if necessary first detailing your objections Esselen Wylie
and explaining your reasons distrusting Commission generally. Secondly feeling
and advice friendly Europeans South Africa about Commission. Thirdly
describing briefly but effectively cruel treatment passive resistance prisoners,
including ladies gaol. Fourthly any other circumstances stirring indignation
community before meeting Sunday. Fifthly declaration made at meeting and
reasons for same. Sixthly any negotiations going on to which public reference may
be made. Seventhly present position and prospects. And lastly any message you
would like send India. Let statement be conciliatory but firm in tone, appreciative
Viceroy’s support so far and calculated inspire hope this country. Statement should
arrive here Tuesday morning without fail.” On December 30, at 9.30 a.m., Gandhiji
received a cable from Gokhale saying: “Publishing statement with additions
important details previous cables.” Gokhale released the statement to the Press on
December 31 and sent Gandhiji the following cable: “Have issued statement today
after editing and incorporating into it portions some previous cables. Statements
sentiments wholly yours, language occasionally altered suit requirements here.
Expect will have excellent effect. Bombay cabled seven thousand yesterday, Madras
cabling one thousand. Had intended seeing Robertson Bombay tomorrow before
departure, but doctor forbids. Sending him special note our case with Shastri.” For the
text of the statement issued by Gokhale, vide “Statement issued by G.K. Gokhale”,

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

12. INTERVIEW TO “THE NATAL MERCURY”1
[DURBAN,

December 29, 1913]
[G ANDHIJI:] The effect of the Indian Congress resolutions which
we have received certainly strengthens our position, because the
Congress has given its powerful and unanimous support, and it has
expressed entire approval of our prayer that Indian interests should be
represented on the Commission. I can therefore only hope that, what
with the Congress’s support, and what with the efforts that are being
made by influential European friends today to induce the
Government to concede our prayer—which has been hailed by the
whole South African Press as being just in itself— that this prayer will
be granted by the Government.
Unless we have a satisfactory reply in reference to our prayer, it
will not be possible for us to take any part in the Commission; but just
now, at the request of friends who have intervened, and in view of the
fact that I am still in telegraphic communication with the Government,
we have decided not to proceed with the contemplated march to
Pretoria on January 1, but that we shall wait until we know that we
have left no stone unturned to arrive at an honourable settlement, and
that there is no hope of such a settlement being concluded. For the
present, the march is only suspended; but all the evidence I am
receiving day by day forces the gravity of the situation on my
attention. I see poor men are already making preparations, and people
who go and tell them that the march is not to be proceeded with on
January 1 are not even believed. I am therefore endeavouring to
circulate a leaflet2 signed by myself informing everyone that we are
suspending the march for the time being.
Asked if it was intended to call out the Indians on strike again on January 1,
1

Gandhiji was interviewed by a representative of The Natal Mercury about the
effect of the Indian National Congress resolutions on the South African question.
These resolutions, adopted at the Karachi session, December 26-28, protested against
the treatment still meted out to Indians in South Africa, declared that the people of the
British dominions which refused Indians the rights of British citizens should be
ineligible for appointments in India, and demanded the abolition of indentured
labour.

Mr. Gandhi said:

We are not calling out the men on January l. But, we shall leave
no stone unturned to bring about a strike, only with a view to bringing
about imprisonment, and nothing else, if all the endeavours we are
making for a settlement with the Government come to naught. I am
hoping that the contemplated march will not be necessary, and there
are reasons for my thinking that it may not be; but the communications that are in my possession are of such a delicate nature that it is
not possible for me to say anything further at this stage.
Mr. Gandhi proceeded to say that he was pained deeply that the indignation of
the Indians was aggravated by the stories of distress by the passive resisters released
from gaol. He proceeded to detail allegations of “brutal and barbarous treatment” in
Durban Gaol—that assaults were committed by Native warders on passive resisters,
that complaints were unheeded, and that many of the prisoners were suffering from
dysentery. It was also alleged that they were given unwashed prison clothing to wear,
were denied the use of books, and were chaffed by responsible officers. Prisoners were
stated to have been even bathed in sheep-dip after taking their bath, while allegations
were made that many prisoners had to hunger-strike before their religious
susceptibilities were respected. All these allegations Mr. Gandhi was reducing to
affidavits, to be sent to the Government for investigation.

14. LETTER TO “THE NATAL MERCURY”
DURBAN,

December 30, 1913
SIR,

Your first leader in today’s issue of your paper invites a
statement from me, which I hope you will permit me to make.
You imagine that a more potent reason for delaying the
contemplated march is “to be found in the fact that the mass of the
local Indian community could not be relied upon to join in the
resuscitation of a form of conflict which recoiled most injuriously
upon the Indians themselves”. There are other inferences, also, you
have drawn from the delay, with which I shall not deal at present. I,
however, assure you that you are wrongly informed if you consider
that the mass of the local Indian community is not to be relied upon
to join the march, if it has ever to be undertaken. On the contrary, the
difficulty to-day is even to delay it and my co-workers and I have
been obliged to send special messengers and to issue special leaflets1
in order to advise the people that the march must be postponed for the
time being. I admit that speculation as to whether the mass of the local
Indian community will or will not join the march is fruitless, because
this will be, if it has to be, put to the test at no distant date. I give my
own view in order that the public may not be lulled into a sense
offalse belief that the movement is confined to a few only among the
community.
1

These are not available.

VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

15

The chief reason, therefore, for trespassing upon your courtesy
is to inform the South African public through your columns that,
whilst the great National Congress that has just closed its session at
Karachi was fully justified in asking, and was bound to ask, for full
citizen rights throughout the British Dominions for all the King’s
subjects, irrespective of caste, colour, or creed, and whilst they may not
and ought not to be bound by local considerations, we in South Africa
have repeatedly made it clear that, as sane people [we] are bound to
limit our ambition by local circumstances, we are bound to recognize
the widespread prejudice, however unjustified it may be, and, having
done so, we have declared—and I venture to re-declare through your
columns—that my co-workers and I shall not be party to any agitation
which has for its object the free and unrestricted immigration of
British Indians into the Union or the attainment of the political
franchise in the near future. That these rights may come in time will, I
suppose, be admitted by all; but when they do come, they will not be
obtained by forcing the pace, as passive resistance is undoubtedly
calculated to do, but by otherwise educating public opinion, and by
the Indian community so acquitting itself in the discharge of all the
obligations that flow from citizenship of the British Empire as to have
these rights given to them as a matter of course. Meanwhile, so far as
my advice counts for anything, I can only suggest that the efforts of
the Indian community should be concentrated upon gaining or
regaining every lost civil right or every such right at present withheld
from the community; and I hold that even this will not happen unless
we are ready to make an effective protest against our civic destruction
by means of passive resistance, and unless through our self-suffering
we have demonstrated to the European public that we are a people that
cherishes its honour and self respect as dearly as any people on earth.
I am, etc.,

M. K. GANDHI

15. HINDI AND TAMIL
The satyagraha campaign, as carried on this time and still
continuing, has hardly a parallel in history. The real credit for this
goes to the Hindi and Tamil speaking brothers and sisters living in this
country. Their sacrifice has been the highest of all. Some of them
16

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

have even lost their lives, killed by the bullets of the white soldiers. As
a tribute to their memory, we have decided to give Hindi and Tamil
news in this paper. Some years ago, we used to bring out this paper in
these two languages as well, but we had to discontinue the practice
owing to some difficulties.1 Those difficulties are not yet over. And
yet, we resume publication in these languages for the duration of the
struggle, that being, in our judgment, the least that we must do, even at
some inconvenience to ourselves, in honour of communities whose
members have made such sacrifices in a struggle of this kind. It is not
with a commercial motive that we are publishing in these languages.
Whether or not to continue the practice after the struggle is over we
can only decide in the light of the circumstances then prevailing.

17. LETTER TO MARSHALL CAMPBELL
110, FIELD S TREET,
DURBAN,

Januay 1, 1914
DEAR MR. MARSHALL CAMPBELL,

I am much obliged to you for your letter of the 30th ultimo,
and for frankly expressing your feelings. I see that recent events have
caused a breach between my friends and myself which must be left to
time and future uniform conduct on my part to heal. I can only give
you my assurance that I know of no agent who has been permitted to
encourage or advise violence.1 It is the essence of passive resistance to
be free from violent methods even under circumstances the most
provoking. I know you will permit me to say that neither Mr.
Gokhale’s acceptance nor the Indian Committee’s acceptance of your
hospitality can be allowed to interfere with what Mr. Gokhale or we
here might consider to be our public duty.2
The strike and the subsequent courting of imprisonment were
not intended to be a protest against the general treatment of
indentured Indians, but against the Government’s breach of promise
given to India’s greatest representative, and the injustice of
perpetuating a cruel tax which has been so universally condemned.
Passive resistance, which your letter seems to condemn in unmeasured
1
In his letter dated December 30, Marshall Campbell had written, inter alia,
“. . . I may add that they [indentured labourers] were only induced to come out by grave
threats of personal violence made by persons whom I believe to be your agents, two
of whom were arrested and fined.”
2
This had reference to Marshall Campbell’s remarks in his letter: “Mr.
Gokhale and your Committee accepted my hospitality, and ate of my salt less than 12
months ago, and between 10,000 and 15,000 Victoria County Indians did the same.”

18

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

terms,1 has been the only weapon of the community for securing
redress of grievances for the last six years, and whilst each stage of it
in its commencement has evoked such condemnation as you have
seen fit to pronounce, reflection that, as time went on, public men were
able to give to the struggle, justified it in their estimation. In a large
measure it brought about the relief for which the weapon was used.
This time it has covered a larger range, it has caused much greater
suffering both in intensity and extent, and has, therefore, called forth a
great, though not unexpected, outburst of indignation, especially from
parties immediately affected. It is hoped that the Government will, in
deciding upon the proposals submitted to them after the utmost
consideration, be guided by wisdom and justice rather than by
expedience. Should it, therefore, be otherwise, and should they reject
our prayer, much as I dislike it, I fear that a recrudescence of the
struggle is inevitable. Posterity alone will be able to judge as to the
wisdom or otherwise of those who are at present guiding the Indians.
I am, etc.,

M. K. GANDHI

The Natal Mercury, 5-1-1914

Campbell had observed: “If anything, it, in my opinion, aggravates the
unfortunate blunder of your policy. More than this, no movement can be successful,
however high the ideals of its founders, if it involves the suffering of innocent and
guilty alike; the inherent injustice of such an effect must work its ruin, and you will
pardon me if I say quite frankly, though as a friend, that many of those you lead are
realizing the weakness of your policy more and more every day, and are coming to the
conclusion that to use a large body of, in the main, contented but ignorant people,
namely, the indentured labourers, by inflaming their passions with high words, false
hopes incapable of realization, and violent threats, as a tool for procuring political
rights by which most of them will never benefit, even if they are ever attained, to put
it very mildly, is not a policy dictated by wisdom and far-sightedness.”

This was evidently in reply to Gokhale’s cable of December 31, 1913,
inquiring if C. F. Andrews and W. W. Pearson had arrived.

At the Wharf were Gandhiji, several Indian associates, H. S. L. Polak, A. H.
West and a number of European clergymen including the Rev. Archdeacon Gregson.
On landing, Andrews greeted Polak and asked: “Where is Mr. Gandhi?” Polak turned to
a slight ascetic figure, dressed in a white dhoti and kurta of such coarse material as an
indentured labourer might wear. Andrews bent swiftly down and touched Gandhi’s feet.

This cable was reportedly sent after a meeting of Andrews and the Indian
leaders. He had asked Gandhiji: “Isn’t it simply a question of Indians’ honour?
Gandhi’s eyes flashed. ‘Yes!’ he said vehemently, ‘That is it, that is it. That is the
real point at issue.’ ‘Then’, said Andrews, ‘I am sure you are right to stand out. There
must be no sacrifice of honour.’ He and Gandhi were friends from that hour; within
two or three days they were ‘Mohan’ and ‘Charlie’ to one another.” Charles Freer

22. SPEECH AT RECEPTION TO C. F. ANDREWS2
[DURBAN,

January 4, 1914]
Mr. Gandhi said that, for the past twenty years, it had invariably been his duty
to act the part of interpreter of the chairman’s speech when it was delivered in the
Hindi or Gujarati language. He had been asked to do soon this occasion. The chairman
had said that the small purse of gold represented the hearty sympathy of their people
1

This was in reply to the following cable dated January 2 from Gokhale:
“Robertson started yesterday. Communicated your intention giving reception arrival.
He, however, thinks best plan small deputation meet him demonstration might cause
misunderstanding. He has sent message he will do his best for community. Papers
announce Godfrey arrived Bombay cable how far he is trustworthy. Am suffering
accumulation fluid cavity heart result extreme exhaustion system. Must lie bed several
days. Your statement published yesterday made up of various cables and elaborated to
nearly two thousand words. Bringing public opinion strongly round your side. Has
Reuter cabled summary.”
2
On Sunday morning, Andrews and Pearson were given a reception by the
Indian Hawkers’ Association at the Surat Hindu Association Dharmashala in Victoria
Street. Gandhiji was given a purse of £60 as donation to passive resistance funds.

for the movement. They might not all be able to go to prison, but they wished to
show that they were heart and soul in the movement. The Hindus of Durban extended a
warm welcome to their guests from India. When the announcement was made in the
papers of their coming, it gave a new hope to them in a time of darkness. They felt
that the hand of God was upon their movement. The chairman mentioned one
grievance which he was desirous of bringing to the notice of Messrs Andrews and
Pearson. That was the fact that many of their caste fellows, who had the right of
domicile, had been refused admittance by the Immigration Officer, who took
advantage of some slight flaw in their evidence and sent them back to India, away
from their friends, to face poverty there.

110, FIELD S TREET,
DURBAN,

January 4, 1914
MY DEAR BOY,

I was delighted to receive your letter. In the first place, ever
since my discharge I have had not a minute’s rest and I hardly get full
sleep any day. In the second place, there were so many to whom I
should have written, that I thought I would neglect you all and you
would understand the reason why; but your letter compels me to write
to you. I think that, on your discharge,1 you will see both mother and
me. Ramdas is looking well and has done well. Devdas has proved a
hero. He has developed a sense of responsibility which was
unexpected. Purbhoodas did almost equally well, but he is not so
quick as Devdas. All the women folk are well and are looking forward
to meeting you all. I am sorry that you were not able to read much. I
think that, if you approach the Magistrate for more books, he will
grant you the permission and you may remind him that you had all
the books you desired granted to you at Johannesburg and elsewhere.
You will be pleased to hear that I had become a most industrious
student at Bloemfontein and I was sincerely sorry to have my studies
interrupted. I gave about eight hours a day to solid reading and
writing, principally Tamil. The authorities kindly gave me every

imprisoned. He is in Christiana. Harilal may return shortly. The
money was sent to Medh’s father. With love from us all.

24. INTERVIEW TO REUTER
DURBAN,

January 4, 1914
Interviewed by Reuter with regard to the correspondence which has been
exchanged between Senator Campbell, the well-known sugar planter, and Mr. Gandhi,
the latter said that he had appealed to Mr. Campbell to continue his co-operation and
sympathy.
Mr. Campbell in reply stated that he adhered to his opinion that the three
pound tax should be repealed and still supported Indians seeking redress from harsh
administration and the licensing laws, bus that nevertheless he appealed to Mr.
Gandhi to desist from lawlessness and not to refuse to accept a Commission
composed of men with judicial minds and of known integrity.
Mr. Gandhi replied that the strike and the subsequent courting of
imprisonment were a protest against the Government’s breach of the promise to Mr.
Gokhale and the three pound tax, not against the general treatment of indentured
Indians. He feared a recrudescence of former measures if the Government rejected the
Indians’ prayers.1

110 F IELD S TREET, D URBAN,

January 5, 1914
DEAR MISS HOBHOUSE1 ,

It was a perfect pleasure to have received your very kind and
generous letter. Had I known how to approach you before, I would
undoubt-edly have endeavoured to enlist your large heart in our
behalf. It was during the Boer war that I came to admire your selfless
devotion to Truth, and I have often felt how nice it would be if the
Indian cause could plead before you for admission; and it is evident
to me that your first telegram 2 uttering a note of warning was an
answer to that yearning. I am loathe to write to you on this question,as
Miss Mol-teno3 has told me how feeble you are now in health. She was
good enough to read to me a part of Miss Greene’s4 letter, telling her
in most pathetic tones how it was the duty of those who loved you to
refrain from imposing fresh burdens on you. I am, therefore, torn by
conflicting emotions. But, as Miss Molteno, who knows you better
assures me that [sic] to expect you now not to interest yourself in our
cause is to misjudge you and to aggravate your illness, because you
would, she says, fret about us without being enabled by us to render
your assistance effective.
If your health permits and if the climate on the North Coast of
Natal would not be too trying for you, I would esteem it a privilege if
you could take rest on the little settlement at Phoenix where Indian

Opinion1 is published. Miss Molteno knows the settlement well. It is
situated about eighty feet above sea-level and is exposed to certain
winds which sweep across the hills that overlook the settlement and
purify the atmosphere. The scenery around is certainly very charming, the site is beautifully isolated, there is no bustle or noise, it is
two miles from the nearest station and I venture to think that you will
find loving hands to administer to your wants, and nothing would give
me personally greater pleasure than, if I were free, to be able to wait
upon you and nurse you. You will, I hope, consider this offer a
coming from the heart and without the slightest hesitation accept it if
you can.
I will not weary you with copies of correspondence and details
about the question. I enclose the telegrams exchanged between
General Smuts and myself, which speak for themselves. We have
always accepted what we could get in matters of detail, but, in this
matter of the Commission2 , we are solemnly bound to sacrifice
ourselves for the principle of consultation3 . In striving to secure this
recognition of an elementary right, if we must, for the time being,
forfeit public sympathy, we must be prepared to do so. Knowing that
the truth is on our side, past experience will enable us to have patience,
and, as days go on, the mists of ignorance will be removed, the cloud
will lift and I have no doubt that Truth will conquer. What we have
asked for is the smallest measure and, if the Government obstinately refuses to grant that measure of
justice, surely it will be an indication of their disinclination to
recognize the status of British Indians throughout the Union. Indeed,
through my twenty years’ experience, I have been able to gather
many an indication of the same spirit and it is really against that that
we are fighting. In those matters to which Passive Resistance is directed, I hold there can be no compromise. Could Daniel have compromised by bowing to one of the laws of Moses and the Persians and not
to others, or would the whole body of those laws have represented the
influence of Satan and, therefore, been unacceptable in toto?
The last paragraph of your letter seems to assume that we are
following the tactics of the high-souled militants of England. May I
say that we have not only not copied them, but, wherever it has been

ours? Indeed, I used to have long discussions with the followers of the
great Mrs. Pankhurst1 on this very question. At no stage do we believe
in the use of physical force, but I am free to confess that we have
certainly been encouraged, in the hour of our weakness, by the noble
example of devotion to duty and self-sacrifice that the militants have
set, though we condemn their methods and tactics as suicidal and
beneath the dignity of woman.

26. LETTER TO “INDIAN OPINION”
[DURBAN,

After January 5, 1914]
TO

THE EDITOR
INDIAN OPINION

I give below a few facts known to me concerning Bhai
Hurbatsingh, who passed away on Monday last2 , believing that readers
of Indian Opinion would like to know them.
When I was in Volksrust gaol two months ago, it was sanctified
by the coming of Hurbatsingh. He was one of the batch of 37 Indians
or so who, after waiting for a while in Charlestown, entered Volksrust
and elected to go to gaol. When I saw Hurbatsingh among them, my
heart overflowed with joy. I became introspective and reflected over

England; vide “Mrs. Pankhurst’s sacrifice”, 19-4-1913

what I had done. My heart was full because even a 70-year-old Indian
like him, who had spent 30 years in Natal as a labourer, had thought
of India, India’s honour and of India’s tapascharya1 in ancient times.
Even in his declining years, he preferred to endure the sufferings of
prison life rather than live in comfort. I grew sad as I reflected: “Dear
self of mine! If you have led your innocent brothers, unlearned but
wise, into a wrong path, what a burden of sin will you have to bear? If
ever you discovered that you had made a mistake, what good would
your remorse do then? The men whom you had led to death would
not come back to life; those who, following your advice, endured the
hardships of gaol-life, would never forget them.” At this thought I
felt sad. But then I considered: “No blame would attach to you if you
acted sincerely in advising your brothers to go to gaol. Truly is it said
that without yagna 2 this world would perish. But yagna is not merely
kindling wood and pouring ghee and other things into it. This may
purify the air, but surely it will not purify the spirit. When we offer up
our bones to burn like wood, pouring out our blood like ghee in
order that they may burn, and sacrifice our flesh to the flames, that
alone will be true yagna, and by such sacrifice will the earth be
sustained. Without such yagna, such sacrifice of self, it cannot be
sustained. No peoplehas risen without self-sacrifice; can it be
otherwise with us? Certainly not.” Reflecting thus, I saw that it was no
matter for grief if an old Indian like Hurbatsingh went to gaol for
India’s sake and died while in prison. I once asked Hurbatsingh why,
in his extreme old age, he thought of going to gaol. In reply he said:
“When all of you, and the women too, are going to gaol, what should
I alone do outside? When you went to Charlestown, I decided to leave
my small farm and follow you. When my friends came to gaol, I also
did the same.” “But, friend,” I asked, “What if you die while in
gaol?” This wise Indian replied: “If I must, I shall. I am an old man;
what is the good of my living on?”
This veteran had been sentenced to imprisonment with hard
labour. When the first batch of prisoners during the first satyagraha
campaign was sentenced to simple imprisonment, the Government, I
believe, hinted to the Courts not to award simple imprisonment to any
Indian satyagrahi. In consequence, after the first cases of simple
imprisonment, no Indian received such sentence. Fortunately, in

Volksrust the gaoler was kind to Hurbatsingh. The latter used to work
in the garden, watering the plants, and his energy put the younger
satyagrahis to shame.
Is there an Indian who will not shed tears of joy at the glorious
death of such an Indian? When Hurbatsingh’s body is carried to the
cremation ground, I do hope that every Indian will follow it on foot
right up to the ground. 1 By paying this homage, we shall not only
honour the memory of the departed one but shall also honour India
and ourselves.2

27. IMMORTAL HURBATSINGH
Hurbatsingh, an indentured Indian, 70 years old, with no kith or
kin, gave up this earthly life on Monday. The whole Indian community mourns for him. He who had not one relative in this wild,
forbidding land has today 150,000 Indians living here as his kinsmen.
His death, which ordinarily no Indian would have heard of, will, in the
unusual circumstances of today, be known to the whole of India. One
may ask, why? The answer is that he was a satyagrahi; and as truth is
eternal, even so a man who resolutely clings to truth is immortal. Just
as one cannot hide the sun by covering it, truth also will come out,
however much one tries to hide it. Therefore, one who serves truth
even in the smallest measure can never be eclipsed. An indentured
labourer of old days, Hurbatsingh did not have to pay the £3 tax;
nevertheless, because the others came out, he too chose to do likewise.
His body has been buried. As soon as the fact was known, a
request was made to the Government for its return. By the time this
article is out, the request will have been granted. When received, the
body will be cremated. We trust that every Indian will follow the
funeral procession.

The funeral procession on January 8 included Europeans and Indians of
different faiths.

28. INTERVIEW TO “PRETORIA NEWS”1
[PRETORIA ,

January 9, 1914]
[G ANDHIJI:] I cannot tell you anything about the confidential
negotiations which are proceeding at the present moment.
[REPORTER:] What about the Railway strike?
1

Gandhiji, accompanied by C. F. Andrews, arrived in Pretoria on the morning
of January 9, for negotiations with Smuts. A brief summary of those observations
appeared in Indian Opinion, 14-1-1914. The Governor-General, Lord Gladstone,
forwarded to the Colonial Office, a clipping of the interview “in which”, he observed,
“Mr. Gandhi gave a personal assurance that he and his friends would refrain from
resuming operations until the railway strike was settled.” In Charles Freer Andrews,
pp. 95-6, there appears a report of this interview which puts it in its proper context:
“At Pretoria, the Editor of the Pretoria News greeted Gandhi in friendly fashion. ‘Are
the Indians going to join the General Strike?’ he asked. ‘No, certainly not,’ replied
Gandhi. ‘We are out for a clean fight. Passive resistance will be suspended.’ ‘May I
publish that?’ ‘No—there is no need to do so.’ The Editor turned to Andrews. ‘Do
persuade him, Mr. Andrews,’ he said. ‘There will be Martial Law within twelve hours.’
Andrews took his meaning; up and down they walked, outside the Editor’s office,
while he argued the point with Gandhi. ‘Of course, you are right to suspend the
struggle,’ he said, ‘but if no one knows till afterwards, all the good effect will be
lost—people will say you did it out of fear?’ At last Gandhi yielded: the message went
out, with all its power for good, to Cape Town and the world. A few minutes later the
strikers cut the telegraph wires.” In Satyagraha in South Africa, Ch. XLVII, Gandhiji
has this to say on his refusal to embarrass the Government: “This decision of ours
created a deep impression, and was cabled to England by Reuter. Lord Ampthill cabled
his congratulations from England. English friends in South Africa too appreciated our
decision. One of the secretaries of General Smuts jocularly said: ‘I do not like your
people, and do not care to assist them at all. But what am I to do? You help us in our
days of need. How can we lay hands upon you? I often wish you took to violence like
the English strikers, and then we would know at once how to dispose of you. But you
will not injure even the enemy. You desire victory by self-suffering alone and never
transgress your self-imposed limit of courtesy and chivalry. And that is what reduces
us to sheer helplessness.’ General Smuts also gave expression to similar
sentiments.”

30

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

I haven’t anything to do with the Railway strike.
I know, but what is your attitude towards it?

I have no attitude. What attitude can we, a voteless and neglected
people, have in such a crisis?
The point is this, are you going to take advantage of the Governments
embarrassment at the present moment to revive your passive resistance and strike
movement?
Mr. Gandhi looked very thoughtful; he paused a moment and then said:

That has never been our policy.
Come, come, plain speaking. Never mind your policy in the past; what are you
going to do now?

For myself I will be no party to embarrassing the Government at
a time like this, we shall follow the policy that we adopted during the
Rand miners’ strike in July.1 At that time we suspended all operations,
and we shall do this again, if necessary. I am most anxious that there
should be no confusion of issues between our case and the case of the
Railwaymen; such confusion might occur if we revived passive
resistance at this moment. In any case I mean to take no unfair
advantage of the Government . . . .
I am hopeful that the negotiations now proceeding and the
representations of our European friends in South Africa may
successfully avert any need for further passive resistance, but whatever
happens (this very emphatically) whether the Minister’s reply to us be
favourable or unfavourable, we shall not resume operations until this
Railway matter is settled; for that you have my personal assurance.
Pretoria News, 9-1-1914

29. IMPORTANT ADVICE2
I have heard that some Indians enter into a second indenture on
the expire of the first. Probably all friends know that there is no need
whatever to renew indenture. Once the £3 tax is removed, there will be
no need for accepting a second term of indenture. While, therefore,
the present struggle is in progress, [no one] should renew indenture
and accept slavery by doing so. I hope every educated man will

MY DEAR LOWER HOUSE,

The uncertainty of our stay here made me neglect correspondence. And I have been continually with Mr. Andrews 1 from rising
hour to bedtime talking about the question or religious topics. I often
say to myself how nice it would have been if you could have been
here. But I am sure that it was the best thing for you not to have come.
You would have been held up like us and what is worse, Mr. Andrews
would never have talked with the same freedom if he had to talk to
two instead of one as now. He entirely lives the Indian life and loves to
live among and with Indians. He had a two-hour interview (private)
with the Governor-General2 and he preached at the Cathedral here last
Sunday.
You being with Mrs. Gandhi I am free from all anxiety. The
interview with Smuts has been indefinitely postponed. He had brief
talks with him but on the question. Sir Benjamin 3 is due to arrive
today. You may now write as if I am not coming there for some time.
With love,
Yours,

31. INTERVIEW WITH GENERAL SMUTS1
P RETORIA ,

January 16, 1914
The original proposal laid before General Smuts by Mr. Gandhi on Friday last
was as follows:
He asked for definite assurances on four points:
(a) The £3 Tax: General Smuts enquired whether he would be satisfied if the payment
of the licence money were abolished, but the licence retained and no further alteration
made in the provisions of Natal Act 17 of 1895. Mr. Gandhi thought that this
solution would meet his requirements, but he urged that if the licence were retained, it
should be made a standing licence not subject to annual renewal.
(b) The marriage question: He did not make it quite clear what precisely he desired, but
General Smuts gathered that his expectations were not unreasonable, and that they
would probably be satisfied if statutory recognition of de facto monogamous wives
1

This official version of what took place at the interview between Gandhiji
and General Smuts on January 16 is extracted from a confidential despatch dated
January 22 which the Governor-General, Lord Gladstone, addressed to the Secretary of
State for the Colonies. The Governor-General, referring to the developments, wrote:
“I am glad to be able to report that the prospects of an early settlement of the
principal points at issue between my Government and the Indian community in this
country have distinctly improved during the past week. Obstacles which it would be
imprudent to disregard still exist, and others, either unforeseen or only dimly
foreseen at present, may yet arise before mutually acceptable legislation can be
passed. But on the whole the situation is more hopeful now than at any previous
period of my term of office.
“Numerous personal interviews have taken place between General Smuts and
Mr. Gandhi, General Smuts and Sir Benjamin Robertson, and Sir Benjamin Robertson
and Mr. Gandhi. Mr. Andrews also has had conversations both with the Minister and
with Sir Benjamin Robertson. General Smuts has shown a most patient and conciliatory temper. In spite of a series of conflicts extending over many years, he retains a
sympathetic interest in Mr. Gandhi as an unusual type of humanity, whose peculiarities, however inconvenient they may be to the Minister, are not dovoid of attraction
for the student. Sir Benjamin has proved himself tactful, judicious, and reasonable. He
has established excellent relations not only with General Smuts but also with the
Prime Minister, and is on friendly terms with the other members of the Cabinet whose
acquaintance he has made, while on Mr. Gandhi his firmness and shrewd common
sense would seem to have exercised a salutary restraining influence. It is no easy task
for a European to conduct negotiations with Mr. Gandhi. The workings of his conscience are inscrutable to the occidental mind and produce complications in wholly
unexpected places. His ethical and intellectual attitude, based a it appears to be on a
curious compound of mysticism and astuteness, baffles the ordinary processes of
thought. Nevertheless, a tolerably practical understanding has been reached.”
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

were accorded.
(c) The admission of South Africa-born Indians into the Cape Province: Mr. Gandhi
did not press for legislation on this point but only for an assurance that the law would
be so administered that the education test would not be applied to such Indians
seeking to enter the Cape. This was to be subject to the understanding that only a
small number would thus seek admission, and that if large numbers came forward, the
education test should be applicable. I cannot vouch for the actual wording of the
stipulation, but I believe that this was its substantial effect.
(d) The declaration said to be required under the Orange Free State Law: General Smuts
pointed out that the Government had already in Mr. Gorges’ letter of the 19th August
(Cd. 7111, page 51) signified their willingness to accept Mr. Gandhi’s suggestion on
this point. Mr. Gandhi said that he did not so understand the relevant passage in that
letter, but that a slight verbal amendment of its terms would meet the difficulty.1
Mr. Gandhi explained that if General Smuts would give him a clear assurance in
writing on his four points, he would regard it as disposing of the whole general
question of Indian grievances. The Commission need not then consider general
grievances or policy. Its enquiry should in that case be limited to the occurrences of
the recent passive resistance campaign and the strike and the various allegations to
which that movement and the manner of its repression had given rise. On that basis
he and his friends would be prepared to appear before the Commission and give
evidence. If the assurance were not forthcoming, they would still be willing to appear
before the Commission and give evidence on all matters included in the terms of
reference, provided that either Sir James Rose-Innes or Mr. Schreiner were added to its
membership. In that event he would raise in detail the whole question of all Indian
grievances dating, I think, from 1885, and he let it be understood that his opening
statement alone would occupy at least two days of the Commission’s time.
If neither of his alternative proposals was accepted, he could have nothing to
do with the Commission and must reserve complete freedom of action although he
would consider himself bound by his promise not to embarrass the Government by a
renewal of passive resistance while the present industrial troubles remained unsettled.
General Smuts pointed out the obvious objections to any interference with the
present constitution of the Commission, and endeavoured to impress on Mr. Gandhi
how desirable it was in his own interests that instead of askingfor assurances he
should state his case on his four points of grievances before the Commission. The
Government would be in a far stronger position to carry remedial legislation if they
could base it on recommendations made by the Commission. From private
conversations with Sir William Solomon and Mr. Esselen, the Minister had gathered
the conviction that remedial legislation would be recommended by the Commission,
and Mr. Gandhi would therefore be ill-advised if he neglected the opportunity of
1

Lord Gladstone here observed: “It will be seen that only the first two of Mr.
Gandhi’s points would involve fresh legislation.”

34

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

making his views on these points clear to the tribunal.1
Mr. Gandhi however insisted on the insuperable obligations of his vow, and
General Smuts ended the interview by promising to consider his proposals and give
him an answer as soon as possible.2
Colonial Office Records: 551/54
1

In Satyagraha in South Africa, Ch. XLVIII, Gandhiji has reported Smuts’
observations as follows: “The Indians had demanded that a member should be
co-opted to the Commission to represent Indian interests. But on this point General
Smuts would not give in. ‘That cannot be done,’ said he, ‘as it would be derogatory to
the Government’s prestige and I would be unable to carry out the desired reforms. You
must understand that Mr. Esselen is our man, and would fall in with, not oppose, the
Government’s wishes as regards reform. Colonel Wylie is a man of position in
Natal and might even be considered anti-Indian. If therefore even he agrees to a repeal
of the £3 tax, the Government will have an easy task before them. Our troubles are
manifold; we have not a moment to spare and therefore wish to set the Indian question
at rest. We have decided to grant your demands, but for this we must have a
recommendation from the Commission. I understand your position too. You have
solemnly declared that you will not lead evidence before it so long as there is no
representative of the Indians sitting on the Commission. I do not mind if you do not
tender evidence, but you should not organize any active propaganda to prevent
anyone who wishes to give evidence from doing so, and should suspend Satyagraha in
the interval. I believe that by so doing you will be serving your own interests as well
as giving me a respite. As you will not tender evidence, you will not be able to prove
your allegations as regards ill treatment accorded to the Indian strikers. But that is for
you to think Over.”
2
For the rest of the despatch covering the subsequent course of negotiations,
vide”Extract from Governor-General’s Despatch”, 22-1-1914. During the last days of
the negotiations, news reached Gandhiji that Kasturba was seriously ill in Durban. At
a moment, on January 21, when the talks had reached a deadlock over a phrase which
General Smuts had wanted to insert in the proposed agreement, an urgent telegram
summoned Gandhiji to Durban; but Gandhiji refused to leave till the deadlock had been
removed. Andrews recorded what happened during that critical night in these words:
“That night we talked till 1 a.m. Finally, an alternative phrase occurred to me. The
difference seemed to be very slight, but Gandhi found it acceptable. ‘If General Smuts
will accept your phrase,’ he said as we went to bed, ‘then everything is finished.’ In
the morning, saying nothing to Gandhi, I went to Smuts and at eight o’clock found
him alone. I told him Gandhi’s personal anxiety, and showed him the suggested
wording. ‘I don’t mind a bit,’ he said, ‘it makes no difference as far as I am
concerned.’ ‘Would you make the change and sign on the spot?’ ‘Certainly.”’ Charles
Freer Andrews, pp. 96-7. The settlement reached, Gandhiji and Andrews left for
Durban, by the 11 o’clock train, on January 22. According to the Governor-General’s
observations at the end of his despatch of January 22, 1914, the sentence inserted at
Gandhiji’s suggestion was: “He also recognizes the motive which makes you
unwilling to revive old sores by courting libel proceedings before another tribunal.”

I have your wire. You will have seen yesterday’s news in my
letter to Polak. The interview with Smuts as also with Robertson was
good. I discussed the passive resistance points fully. I have not the
time just now to set them forth. But I shall try to do so in my next
letter. Mr. Andrews had nearly 1 hours with Sir Benjamin today. He
meets an Indian deputation on Monday. Now we shall have to await
events. Mr. Andrews is a wonderful man full of wonderful experiences. I am most anxious to nurse Mrs. Gandhi. She needs it and asks
for it. But I am still a prisoner and cannot give her the attention I
should like to. Lazarus may come there from Newcastle. If he does
you should soothe him. Miss Schlesin wants instructions about the
ladies who are coming out. I have given them in full in my letter to
Polak. I am, therefore, not writing to her separately. Please tell her so.
You will keep your eye on all who are to be discharged. They

will be contrary to that you have feared. All is gain for you and me. I
see that our difficulties in India will probably be less than we had
expected. But as you say, you want me to discuss this when we meet.
So I shall say no more.
I was pained to see. P. K. Naidoo’s letter. I look to you to
soothe them. The complaint is not without foundation, I fear, and Miss
Schlesin is probably at the back of it. But you are just the one to deal
with the crisis.
I endorse all you say regarding Indian Opinion. And if the
paper can be turned out there, certainly it should be. In the new
circumstances that we have found, West’s presence is certainly not
needed in Durban now. If the struggle revives we shall have to see. We
could at any time get out stuff printed at the Mercury office. The
current number is undoubtedly horrible nothing of it was printed at
Phoenix, is it not so? I have already suggested to West that he might
now shift to Phoenix. Neither Mr. Andrews nor Mr. Pearson require
guides. In all these matters however you should take the initiative.
Consult me by all means where necessary but you may ignore me too
when there is no time for consultation.
I am pining to come down and nurse Mrs. Gandhi. But I feel
that I dare not do so just at present. I must treat this as of primary
importance. General Smuts now knows my domestic position and he
may hurry forward if he likes. In any case it cannot be long delayed
now seeing that the industrial crisis is now practically over. Meanwhile
Mr. Andrews is moving forward. He has got a wonderful grasp of the
central position and he is pushing it forward with all the spiritual force
he possesses.

before returning. I owe a visit to the Johannesburg people. They are
most anxious. I hope you will study Mirza. I am glad the boys are

I have asked Lazarus to run down to Durban himself, but if he does
not, you may certainly go there and see the people who receive
rations, etc.
Ephraim wrote to me too in the same strain as in the letter sent
by you. If his account is true, and it must be, Sir Benjamin is worse
than Lord Emmott. He is a dangerous, weak and shifty man. He would
not dare talk in that strain to you and to me. Even Ephraim could see
that he was frightening. We have to watch him. Fortunately, we are
passive resisters and we cannot be harmed by anybody but ourselves.
So if we fear ourselves, one need fear no earthly power. He left a poor
impression on Mr. Andrews and me. I send you the letter received by
me also. Please show both to Polak, West and others. Andrews has seen
both. Do Christopher, Lazarus, Lazarus Gabriel and others come near
you? How do you find the atmosphere in Durban?
My task here is incomparably easier than that of the workers
there.
How are you keeping mentally and bodily? I hope you are not
spending money uselessly. Remember your aim is poverty. Realize it
whilst you have the resources.
Andrews is away just now at the Government House lunching.
With love,

P RETORIA , B OX 1156,

Paush Vad 8, 1970, Monday [January 19, 1914 ] 1
CHI. CHHAGANLAL,

I have your letter. How nice it would have been if it was not
necessary to call a doctor for Ba. But no one is at fault in that. How
can one find fault where all things are done in good faith?
It will be good for us if Mirza is really good and honest and
stays with us. Train him affectionately. Same is true of Bhawani
Dayal.
I do not like it that we should employ paid compositors for . . .2
work. Are so many of us not enough? You have done a good thing in
making it a rule for the children [to work in the press].
Mismanagement of the newspaper is painful. I guess that Miss
Schlesin 3 is responsible for it. I am somewhat disappointed with her.
However, she may not be responsible this time. It is necessary that you
write to West4 and sort out the things. I have already written to her to
go and live in Phoenix. Check what Bhawani Dayal writes in Hindi
and give it for printing.
Talk to Miss Schlesin about Johannesburg. Get the address of
Narottam and write to him that we would stop sending him Indian
Opinion if he did not send the money. What you write is correct. I,
too, do not approve of an agency. Whoever wants Indian Opinion,
should subscribe toit directly. I, too, will write to Johannesburg from
here. But to depend on me at present in such cases is useless.

37. LETTER TO SECRETARY FOR INTERIOR1
P RETORIA ,

January 21, 1914
TO

THE S ECRETARY FOR THE INTERIOR
P RETORIA
SIR,

Before leaving for Phoenix I venture to express my thanks to
General Smuts for the patient and kindly interviews that he has been
pleased to grant me during a time of overwhelming pressure.
My countrymen will remember with gratitude his great consideration.
I understand that the Minister is unable to accept (with regard to
the Indian Enquiry Commission) either (1) my suggestion that a
member representing Indian interests should be co-opted when
questions of policy are enquired into; or (2) my suggestion that a
second Commission, with Indian representation, should be appointed
to deal with these questions only; the present Commission in that case
becoming purely judicial. I submitted a third proposal also, but this, in
view of the Government’s decision, I need not state here. Had any of
my suggestions been viewed favourably by the Government, it would
have been possible for my countrymen to assist the labours of the
present Commission. But with regard to leading evidence before this
Commission (which has a political as well as a judicial character) they
have conscientious scruples, and these have taken with them a solemn
and religious form. I may state briefly that these scruples were based
on the strong feeling that the Indian community should have been
either consulted or represented where questions of policy were
1

This was reproduced in Indian Opinion, 28-1-1914; also, a summary is
found in Satyagraha in South Africa, Ch. XLIX.
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

41

concerned.
The Minister, I observe, appreciates these scruples, and regards
them as honourable, but is unable to alter his decision. As, however,
by granting me the recent interviews he has been pleased to accept the
principle of consultation, it enables me to advise my countrymen not
to hamper the labours of the Commission by any active propaganda,
and not to render the position of the Government difficult by reviving
passive resistance, pending the result of the Commission and the
introduction of legislation during the forthcoming session.
If I am right in my interpretation of the Government’s attitude
on the principle of consultation, it would be further possible for us,
without violating the spirit of the vow we have taken, to assist Sir
Benjamin Robertson, whom the Viceroy with gracious forethought has
deputed to give evidence before the Commission.
A word is here necessary on the question of allegations as to
ill-treatment during the progress of the Indian strike in Natal. For the
reasons above stated the avenue of proving these through the Commission is closed to us. I am personally unwilling to challenge libel
proceedings by publishing the authentic evidence in our possession. I
would far rather refrain altogether from raking up old sores. I beg to
assure the Minister that as passive resisters we endeavour to avoid as
far as possible any resentment of personal wrongs.1 But in order that
our silence may not be mistaken, may I ask the Minister to recognize
our motive and reciprocate by not leading evidence of a negative
character before the Commission on the allegations in question.
Suspension of passive resistance moreover carries with it a
prayer for the release of the bona-fide passive resistance prisoners
now undergoing imprisonment either in the ordinary gaols or the
mine compounds2 which have been declared as such.
Finally, it might not be out of place here to recapitulate the
points on which relief has been sought. They are as follows:
(1) Repeal of the £3 tax in such a manner as the Indians relieved
will virtually occupy the same status as the indentured Indians
discharged under the Natal Law 25 of 1891.
(2) The marriage question.
1

Vide Satyagraha in South Africa, Ch. XLVIII.
Since all the passive resisters could not be accommodated in the gaols, the
Government resorted to use of mine compounds for the purpose.
2

42

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

(These two are the points that, I have verbally submitted, require
fresh legislation.)
(3) The Cape entry question.
(This requires only administrative relief, subject to the clear
safeguards explained to the Minister.)
(4) The Orange Free State question.
(This requires merely a verbal alteration in the assurance
already given.)
(5) An assurance that existing laws specially affecting Indians will
be administered justly and with due regard to vested rights.
I venture to suggest that the Nos. 3, 4 and 5 present no special
difficulty, and that the needful relief might now be given on these
points as an earnest of the good intentions of the Government
regarding the resident Indian population.
If the Minister, as I trust and hope, views my submission with
favour, I shall be prepared to advise my countrymen in accordance
with the tenor of this letter.1
I have, etc.,

shall not take it as concluding a settlement, it will be an important step

40. INTERVIEW TO “RAND DAILY MAIL”
[JOHANNESBURG ,

January 23, 1914]
Yesterday a Mail representative asked Mr. M. K. Gandhi for a statement of the
position at present. Mr. Gandhi—barefooted and clothed in white, an indication of
the deep religious view now being taken of the Indian cause —has taken offices at 15
Anderson Street where he is in touch with his countrymen in prison, and with the rest
of the world by wire and cable.

[ GANDHIJI:] I hope that the European public in South Africa will
recognize the spirit in which the Indians are endeavouring to meet the
serious deadlock that arose through non-representation of Indian
interests on the Commission, and that they will also understand and
reciprocate the attitude I am advising my countrymen to take
up in connection with the allegations of ill-treatment during my incarceration.
Our suspension of passive resistance, and our refraining from
taking any action regarding the allegations should leave the public
and the Government free to calmly consider the five points that gave
rise to passive resistance on their merits, and which five points have, in
my opinion, commanded almost universal sympathy. No reasonable
man can question our right to have Indian marriages recognized as
legal, or our right to have the three pounds tax unconditionally repealed. The other points of passive resistance, as I have already stated,
require only administrative solution. As you will observe from my
letter, the points are exactly the same as they were enumerated in Mr.
Cachalia’s letter to the Government sent immediately before the
revival of passive resistance last year. In conclusion, I would like to
state that we appreciate the action of the Government in releasing our
passive resistance prisoners.

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

43. SPEECH AT MASS MEETING1
[DURBAN,

January 25, 1914]
Mr. Gandhi, before proceeding to explain the terms of the provisional agreement, announced that Mr. Andrews had received a letter from England preparing him
for the death of his beloved mother, whom he had expected to meet on his arrival in
England. He also added that Mr. Andrews was suffering fromfever due to the strain
under which he had worked in Pretoria in connection with the agreement. Not with
standing these facts, Mr. Andrews had insisted on attending the meeting.
Mr. Gandhi addressed the meeting at length, both in English and Hindustani;
his remarks being subsequently rendered into Tamil. Mr. Gandhi said that those to
whom he was addressing his remarks in English would, he hoped, have read what had
been published in the papers, but he would give them the purport of the agreement
with the Government. At the first interview he had had with General Smuts, he had
placed before him three propositions, the acceptance of any one of which would have
enabled the community to lead evidence before the Commission without violating the
solemn declaration made some time ago on that very ground. These alternatives were
that either the Government should appoint another Commission and restrict the
scope of the present Commission purely to a judicial inquiry into the allegations that
had been made as to ill-treatment and cruelty, while the other should go into the
question of grievances, when the community would be able to lead its evidence before
both; or that a member should be co-opted to the Commission to represent Indian
interests who would sit specially on the Commission hearing the statement of
grievances as apart from the allegations of cruelty, so that the functions of this
Commission could clearly be divided into judicial and political; or that the scope of
the present Commission should be restricted purely to a judicial inquiry, and that
before the community’s appearance before it, the Government should grant the
community’s request in terms of Mr. Cachalia’s letter2 , namely, the five points (1)
the repeal of the £3 tax; (2) the restoration of the status of Indian wives as it existed
before the Searle judgment; (3) the restoration of the right of South Africa-born
Indians to enter the Cape; (4) the removal of the little difficulty that still exists with
reference to theracial bar regarding the Orange Free State; and (5) the question of the

A mass meeting of Indians numbering over 3,000 was held under the
auspices of the Natal Indian Association to discuss the details of the provisional
agreement between Gandhiji and Smuts, and to take action thereon. Imam Abdul Cadir
Bawazeer presided.

just administration of existing laws with due regard to vested rights. The last three
points could be dealt with administratively; the first two only by amending
legislation, and he had ventured to submit to General Smuts the easiest and the
quickest way in which the matter could be dealt with. General Smuts had said that he
would consider the matter, and after he had considered and conferred with the Cabinet,
he said, in the presence of Mr. Andrews, that the Government were willing to grant
these things, but wanted the Commission to sift them, and that they could not
possibly, though they would gladly have met the community, meet them at that stage
with reference to its propositions regarding the Commission.
Of course, that would create a deadlock, and that meant either passive
resistance and all that that meant, or it meant a suspension of passive resistance until
the Government had had a chance, until the Commission had had a chance, of doing
what they proposed to do, and he had had no difficulty in coming to the conclusion,
after consultation always with Mr. Andrews, that the community could fairly suspend
passive resistance, seeing that the Government had taken up the, what he considered,
reasonable attitude, and seeing also that the Government were prepared to understand
and appreciate that the community was bound by its solemn obligation not to take
part in the Commission, and not to resent that attitude on the part of the community,
and, as against that, he had suggested to General Smuts that, if the community
suspended passive resistance, it was only fair that Government should release the
passive resistance prisoners then undergoing imprisonment. There then remained the
very serious questions of the allegations of cruelty. What was to be done with regard
to those if the community was not to lead evidence even with regard to the judicial
aspect of the Commission, and yet it seemed clear that in the present circumstances
they could not lead evidence. It then meant that they should publish a book
containing the whole of the evidence in their possession, and challenge anybody
who wished to bring libel proceedings against the community, so that in defending
the charge the community could prove its case. As a passive resister, it immediately
occurred to him that there should be no difficulty in dropping those proceedings. That
would avoid all irritation, and in the estimation of those who might think for
themselves and who knew the history of passive resistance the community would
stand justified. In any case, if the community could stand justified in the estimation of
the Government, and if the community could ask the Government to appreciate its
motive in not challenging libel proceedings, he felt that the community could ignore
what the world might say as to its being afraid now of coming to a court of law
because it had really no evidence, and that it had simply taken allegations to India in
order to work on feeling there. They must tolerate such criticism from the world, for
the world would have something to say against the best actions, but, if the Government appreciated thecommunity’s attitude, he felt that, as passive resisters, it became
them to act in that manner. They were not passive resisters of the purest type. They

48

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

had, for example, taken advantage of law and defended actions in law courts; pure
passive resisters would not have done that. But they had not yet reached the purest
stage of passive resistance. They must, however, keep such an ideal actively before
them and, perhaps, one day, they would have made such an approach to that state that
they would be considered perfect passive resisters. Till they had reached that stage,
they could not call themselves perfect passive resisters, but they need not therefore
remain stationary, and he had felt that they might take that step in advance, and he
had come to the conclusion that that was a proposition that might be submitted to the
Government. The net effect of the letter written to him by the Government and their
reply was, in his opinion, that they had accepted the principle of consultation, that
they hat recognized the motive of the community in dropping the question of the
allegations altogether, that they recognized the community’s motive in not leading
evidence before the Commission, that they had given an assurance that they wished
to settle the matter in accordance with the community’s submission, and they wanted
to do this through the Commission, but they felt that the community’s demands were
so reasonable and had been so sanctified and strengthened by the suffering that it had
undergone during the past months, that there should be no difficulty in securing the
recommendation from the Commission. They felt, he thought, also confident because
of the presence of Sir Benjamin Robertson and because of the prestige that was
behind Sir Benjamin Robertson, that he came not in his individual capacity but as the
representative of the Viceroy, that as such his testimony before the Commission was
bound to carry its due weight. And under those circumstances they need not worry
themselves thinking or fearing what might happen; and why need a passive resister
ever fear so long as he had the purest weapon in the world at his disposal? The future
lay entirely in their own hands, and, holding that future as firmly as ever, he had no
hesitation in recommending the adoption of the agreement, and he hoped that the
meeting would approve the action they had taken. At the same time he had not bound
the community. He had bound the community on occasions when he had gone with a
clear mind and when he had known what the community had already asked for, but on
this occasion a new situation had arisen, and for that situation he certainly required
the ratification of the community. He could not possibly bind the community with
reference to this matter which he had not himself contemplated. He had therefore
stated to General Smuts that he was prepared to advise his countrymen in accordance
with the tenor of his letter, but he had not bound the community, so that they were
free agents entirely and might dismiss the agreement from their minds if they wished,
but he believed that they might accept it—it was perfectly honourable, dignified, and
would save an amount of misery. What was more, they wanted, if they possibly could,
to conciliate theViceroy. He had said that Viceroy or no Viceroy, Mr. Gokhale or no
Mr. Gokhale, no matter what friends or the world said, if their consciences did not
approve, if their oath did not approve, they could not accept their views, but when it
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

49

was possible for them to keep their oath to satisfy their conscience, he thought that
then they should go to the utmost length in meeting the wishes of their friends, and
such a noble Viceroy, for whom, perhaps, there was no equal except perhaps, Lord
Ripon and Lord William Bentinck; and he did not know what the Viceroy might still
have in store for them. But that was the picture one formed of the Viceroy, and that
had been strengthened by what Mr. Andrews had told him of his noble qualities. They
ought to take into account the Viceroy’s wishes at that stage, seeing that it was
possible for them to do so without violating their oath. Their distinguished countryman, whom India had idolised, to whom they offered reverence, who, while lying on a
sick bed, had yet worked for their cause and made it world-wide and had made India ring
from end to end with that and nothing else—Mr. Gokhale—also desired it. Lord
Ampthill also had been saying: “They had a noble cause, they were bound to win; let
them now stay their hand; they had made sufficient demonstration; they had aroused
the conscience of the United Kingdom; let them now even give their evidence under
protest before the Commission.” That view they bad been unable to accept, but they
could accept the present arrangement. From every point of view, the agreement was
good, dignified, and worthy of acceptance.1

DURBAN
[SIR,]

We understand that our discharge from imprisonment, on the
18th ultimo, before the expiry of our respective sentences, was due to
the recommendation of the Indian Grievances Commission, to enable
the Indian community to have such assistance as we were able to
givein order to prepare and place its case before the Commission. It is,
therefore, a matter of deep and sincere regret that we are unable, for
the reasons already set forth in the correspondence between the first
undersigned and the Minister of the Interior, 1 with whose tenor we
understand the Commission is already acquainted, to avail ourselves of
the opportunity for which we are indebted to it.
We earnestly trust that our refraining from appearing before the
Commission, in the circumstances therein described, will not be
regarded by it as an act of discourtesy.

Elsewhere in this issue is published a translation of these letters

enough space or time to offer detailed comments in this number. The
following is the upshot of the two letters:
(1)
(2)
1

Not a single Indian must give evidence before the
Commission.
The Government has turned down the request for
enlargement of the Commission.

Vide the following item.

VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

51

(3)

If, therefore, Indians gave evidence, it would mean
violation of the community’s pledge.
(4) The Government has recognized that our refusal to give
evidence before the Commission is based on conscientious
grounds.
(5) Our refusal to produce, in another court, evidence on
flogging, etc., since we are unable to do so before the
Commission, does not imply weakness on our part. On the
contrary, we show ourselves the better satyagrahis for that.
The Government appreciates this attitude.
(6) We have been pressing, in recent times, that the
Government should consult us in regard to measures
affecting us; this demand has been conceded.
(7) In view of this, we shall be justified in placing our case
before Sir Benjamin Robertson.
(8) The Government has declared its intention to satisfy us by
conceding our demands and introducing necessary
amendments in the law, and it hopes to do so without
delay in the ensuing session of Parliament.
(9) In view of this, we should give an opportunity to the
Government to carry out its intention and should postpone
resumption of satyagraha.
(10) The Government is bound not to lead negative evidence
before the Commission in regard to flogging and other
repressive measures.
(11) The Government will release the satyagrahis now in gaol.
The Government’s position is that whatever it intends to grant, it
will do through the Commission.
If the Government acts in this way, we may hope that this great
struggle is near its end. If it does not, we lose nothing. We shall be
able to show greater strength still. By taking the step we have done, we
have met the wishes of the Viceroy and have refrained from
provoking the local community; we shall not appear to have treated
the advice of our friends and counsellors with contempt and, if we
have to resume the struggle, we shall make our satyagraha shine all the

48. VIEWS ON THE MARRIAGE QUESTION3
February 2, 1914
Mahommedan and Hindu monogamous marriages shall be
legalized by an amendment of the immigration law or by a special
statute. Statutory legalization can be effected by a system of registration whereby all past monogamous marriages will be entered in a
record book to be kept by the respective religious priests, who will be
authorized marriage officers, and the validation of these unions will
date back to the original marriage ceremony, whether performed in
South Africa or in India. Future marriages will also be celebrated by
1

This was sent jointly by Gandhiji and C. F. Andrews.
The Reuter-South Africa Press Agency released on January 28 the following
news report about the Durban meeting: “At a meeting of the Natal Indian Congress
tonight, it was decided to give evidence before the Indian Enquiry Commission. This
body does not support Gandhi.”

The typescript of this item bears the heading “Mr. Gandhi’s Position” and is
evidently the gist of Gandhiji’s views presumably recorded by himself after a
discussion or an interview.

these priests religiously and simultaneously recordedin the record
book, and no other marriage between one of the parties and another
person could be so recorded or otherwise validated during the lifetime
of the other.
Legal effect would be that no Hindu or Mahommedan will be
able to take to himself more than one wife, but it will not preclude him
from taking a number of women whom he calls his wives, but who, in
the eyes of the law, will be considered as concubines. Such, says Mr.
Gandhi, is the state of English marriages today. This does not mean
that he wants the State to recognize any polygamous marriages. But
he objects to a declaration being made by either party to the marriage
contract that neither will take another partner in future, because any
such declaration would be tantamount to a renunciation of their
religion.
In the case of a past marriage, a man can have only one wife
before he can make the declaration that she is his only wedded wife.
DIVORCE

A marriage which is legalized according to the South African
law can only be dissolved in terms of that law. A woman can only be
divorced under South African law for adultery or desertion.

I have had two letters from you. I am also sorry I had no

It is possible that you will not feel the effects just now. But never
forget that tamasic food 2 cannot but have an evil effect. I am sure it
will do you good in future if you discipline your senses. For all that

I can see, there has been no spiritual gain to you through your
experience of gaol. You have great need to cultivate thoughtfulness.
It is a rare gain to have come into contact with Mr. Andrews.
I should like you to take the fullest advantage of theoccasion by
preserving the utmost purity. So far, Mr. Andrews has expressed
himself perfectly satisfied about you.
Keep an account of every pice you spend. Have no shame about
doing any work for Mr. Andrews. You may even massage his calves.
Having done so once myself, I know that he probably finds it
agreeable. Polish his shoes and tie up the laces. You must not forget to
write to me every day. Maintain a diary of meetings with all persons
and the developments from day to day.

50. WHO MAY BE DEPORTED?
Seen superficially, the difference between satyagraha and brute
force is so subtle that it escapes notice and both satyagrahis and
non-satyagrahis, i.e., those who believe in brute force, are misled.
Some of our well-wishers and friends did not like our strike in Natal,
as they thought we had overstepped the limits of satyagraha.
Others mistakenly imagined that the recent strike of the white railwaymen was satyagraha, though the difference between their aim and ours
in going on strike is as great as that between North and South. If we
went on strike, it was not in order to harass the Government. We only
wanted to suffer—do tapascharya—by going to gaol. In the event, we
find that our victory is at hand. That victory is also unique. We seek
no political powers for ourselves. We only wish to preserve our
self-respect and defend our religion. Whatever we may suffer in our
own persons, we shall never seek to injure our opponent or dislodge
him from office. The railwaymen’s attitude is the precise opposite of
this. Their fight is not for self-respect. They have nothing to do with
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

55

religion. They wanted a rise in their pay—wanted improvement in
their economic condition. They went on strike not in order to get
themselves gaoled but with the object of bringing pressure on the
Government. If the latter were to use force against them, they, too,
would, if they could, use force in return. If it were possible, they
would even overthrow the Government and installthemselves in power.
In fact, that is their ultimate object. And so they have had to surrender
in sheer helplessness before superior force. The Government, too, on
its part, acted boldly and deported them overnight, secretly, without
producing them in any court. All the world has commended its action
and praised its courage. If it were to deport us, it would lay itself open
to the charge of being oppressive, though we, of course, would have to
submit with a smiling face. There is thus a vast difference, which every
Indian should note and understand, between satyagraha and asatyagraha 1 . Satyagraha is not a game in which one might either win or
lose. There is no room for failure in it. Brute force has to take its
chance of success or failure. And the odds are always with the
stronger party, irrespective of the rights of the case.

53. THE IMMIGRATION ACT
The interpretation of this Act daily presents new difficulties. The
latest is Justice Broome’s decision in the matter of Dawad Ismail and
Daya Purshotam against the Immigration Officer. According to
Justice Broome’s interpretation of the Act, the Supreme Court may
not even grant an interdict against that officer, acting under the Act of
last year, in respect of persons seeking to re-enter the Union as was the
case in the matter we are discussing. Thus the Supreme Court will be
powerless, if Justice Broome’s decision holds good, to prevent a
manifest miscarriage of justice, as happened in this case, through the
stupidity of the under-officials. As Justice Broome himself remarked,
here the ends of justice were not defeated only because the aid of the
Court was improperly invoked and as improperly given by the Court
granting the interdict. If such is the correct reading of the law, every
Indian is entirely at the mercy of Immigration Officers. The only
comfort that the Court could give to the parties grossly injured was
that they had not to bear the costs of crown although the proceedings
were irregularly brought by them. It is true that the Court came most
reluctantly to the decision it did. But we cannot eternally live on
sympathy unless it leads to useful action. This case is merely a sample
of several others like it. Every section of the Act—even the protective
sections—seems to have been designed, wittingly or unwittingly, to
harass the resident Indian population. So that the law not only
prohibits Indian immigration in practice, but it materially interferes
with the liberty and the free movement, within the law, of the resident
Indian population of the Union.
Take, again, the case recently decided by the now defunct
Appellate Board, appointed for Natal under the Act. There, Mr. Binns,
delivering the judgment of the Board, reluctantly granted relief to a
man who possessed a domicile certificate issued under the old Act and
with which certificate he was completely identified. Why was there this
reluctance? Why should an Indian be called upon to tax his memory
as to what happened fifteen years ago? The title-deeds of property
once granted cannot be questioned. They are conclusive proof of title.
Why should a domicile certificate be treated differently? These
certificates were granted after due and exhaustive—and in many cases
vexatious—inquiry. By what right are they now questioned? If the Act
58

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

gives such powers to Immigration Officers, the sooner it is amended
the better it will be for both the Government and the people affected
by the Act.
What is, however, perhaps more ominous even than the above
mentioned legal proceedings is the severe administration of the Act. It
is clear that, had the officers done their duty by the persons who were
seeking re-entry—not those who were seeking to immigrate into the
Union—the cases need never have arisen. The officials are certainly
going mad over their administration of the Act against persons in the
Cape and Basutoland who have continually to pass through the Free
State on their way to the other Provinces. To expect them each time to
take out temporary permits is to put an unwarranted tax upon their
purses and is an unnecessary annoyance to the men who have to apply
for permits. The old practice of letting Indian passengers go through
unchallenged never caused the slightest difficulty to the administration and it ought to be continued.The case of a boy that has happened
in Pretoria is also of the same type. Surely the child, whatever may be
the meaning of the Act, is entitled to enter the Transvaal, seeing that
he is the son beyond doubt of his father and that his mother is dead.
Indeed, the Government have practically bound themselves to
recognize at least administratively the right of such children to join
their parents who may be in South Africa. But in the Pretoria case, the
Appellate Board has interpreted the Act, too, in favour of the Indian
applicant. Yet the Government are not satisfied. They must seek to
upset the finding of the Appellate Board which is appointed by them
and whichhas powers given largely to protect the administration rather
than the persons coming under its lash. The fact that the Government
are challenging the liberal interpretation of the Act shows that they
want it to be interpreted as strictly as it is administered. It is against
this wretched spirit that we must wage war, if we are to live in this
country as men.

54. REQUEST TO LEADERS
We have carefully studied the evidence given by Mr. Anglia and
Mr. Dada Osman and it is our considered view that both the leaders
have done harm to the community. That the Commissioners pay
compliments to them is of no account. Their evidence seems to
suggest that our only grievances about licences and immigration are
those that they mentioned. By giving the evidence that they did, they
set a limit [to what we could demand]. It happens, however, that theirs
is not the last word on behalf of the community. Even if their
demands are accepted, much will remain and, so long as this is not
settled, there will always remain the possibility of the Indian
community resuming satyagraha. If they were bent on giving
evidence, it was their duty to put it all together and have it formulated
by a reliable lawyer before presenting it. It was their primary duty to
the community to have accepted the resolution passed by thousands
of people to boycott the Commission and to have remained silent. If,
however, they wished to give evidence, they should have been more
careful. Their evidence has had the unhappy result of provoking the
thoroughly hostile evidence of Mr. Wincall against us. If Mr. Wincall
were right in his facts, there would have been nothing that we could
do. But we know that his evidence is not factually true, and that he has
made many statements which are altogether false. Those who claim to
be leaders should have a better sense of their duty. If they were keen
on tendering evidence, they should have produced a number of
witnesses and not behaved with the utmost irresponsibility, as Mr.
Sooker did, just when the Commission’s sittings were coming to a
close. They had known for a month that the Commission would be
sitting and should have started preparing well beforehand so that they
could give evidence which would be sound. We therefore believe that
these two leaders, instead of doing their duty by the community, have
done it harm. Having said this, we also thank them for having
refrained from washing the dirty linen of the community before the
Commission. Mr. Anglia stated that he could speak with authority on
behalf of all the Indians of established standing and reputation. Who
are these Indians on whose behalf he was speaking? If Mr. Anglia’s
claim is right, we pity these well-established Indians and feel sorry for
them. We hold that Mr. Anglia has erred in making such a statement
60

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

and has failed to pay due regard to his position and the responsibility
that rests on him.
About Mr. Sooker, we simply refuse to comment. The
youngman is carried away by pride. As regards Mr. Aiyar, what can
we say? He has given evidence without thinking. It was good of him to
have made it plain that he spoke not on behalf of anyone, but on his
own responsibility and only for himself. He might not have, therefore,
done much harm.

55. ON MARRIAGES
We know that the marriage question has now become the most
serious one in this country. The Commission is in a fix about it. The
question raises the issue of an important amendment in the laws of the
country. We hold that the evidence given by Mr. Anglia and others on
this subject was misguided. The problem is so complicated that they
should not have meddled with it. In any case, they should have done
so with full understanding. Let us now consider what the question
involves. The correspondence carried on by Mr. Cachalia means that
an Indian marriage which is monogamous in fact should be recognized. If a person has more than one wife, the Government, as a matter
of grace, should permit the entry of all his wives and his minor
children, provided he is an old resident. If anyone marries two women
in future, he should be allowed to bring in one of them. Wives of the
last two categories will be entitled legally to no other rights. In this, we
are not binding ourselves for the future. The Commission, it appears,
insists that, where a man with only one wife desires to have his marriage legally recognized, the marriage should be considered monogamous only if he makes a solemn declaration that he will not take
another wife during the life-time of the first one. Mr. Gandhi has
strongly opposed this line of argument and pointed out that signing
such a declaration amounts to repudiating Hinduism and Islam in the
matter of marriage. If the law recognized only the first wife, that
would be a different matter. In this case, no Hindu or Muslim would
be acting contrary to his religion. Recognition of such marriages
would safeguard the rights of hundreds of Indians and these Indians
will generally have only one wife. The Government is committed to
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

61

recognizing the wife in a monogamous marriage. The law here also
does that. The Commission, or anyone else for that matter, has no
right to tie us down for the future. True, the [exclusive] recognition of
monogamous marriages is likely to curb the practice of polygamy.
Which husband will like to have one wife legally recognized and
another treated as a concubine?
Less than this we cannot accept. More than this it is almost
impossible that we can get. In any case, it seems satyagraha will above
be justified for securing more. If our demands are met as above, the
honour [of our religions] will have been upheld and hundreds of
Indian families will have a chance of being happy.
[From Gujarati]
Indian Opinion, 11-2-1914

56. IMPORTANT IMMIGRATION CASES
There have been two important immigration cases in Natal. As
we were busy writing on other matters, we have had so far no time to
explain them. We take the opportunity of doing so now. In one case,
an unusual one, the judgment was given by Justice Broome. The
Indian concerned might have had to leave this country altogether. The
position was this: The petitioner, who arrived from India in October
last, was not permitted to come in. He did not appeal against this as
required by law. He went back to India, but came again in January.
Again the officer stopped him. This time the petitioner’s lawyer
obtained an interdict from the Supreme Court, which prevented the
officer from deporting him. Finally, the Attorney-General conducted
an inquiry and found that the petitioner had been wrongly sent back
and that he was entitled to stay in Natal. His right of residence,
thus, was recognized, having been admitted by the Attorney-General.
But the Court had yet to decide who should pay the expenses incurred
in obtaining the interdict against the officer. Deciding the point, Mr.
Justice Broome held that there was no provision in the lawgranting the
right of applying for an interdict against an [immigration] officer.
Under the law, the officer’s order can only be set aside in a case
involving corruption and bribery. There was no such thing in this
case. Nevertheless, the Court felt that the officer had acted hastily and
erred in sending the petitioner away. Had an interdict not been
granted, legal though this might have been, it would have resulted in
62

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

injustice to the petitioner and cost him his right. The Court decided
that, in the circumstances, the costs should be borne by the parties
themselves. This decision cannot be said to be in our favour. If the
Court cannot intervene in cases of undue haste on the part of officers,
the latter might pass arrogant and arbitrary orders, as caprice takes
them. In matters involving rights of persons, there is bound to be
injustice if supreme powers are vested exclusively in the Executive.
Justice Broome’s decision cannot be accepted as correct. If fact,Courts
always have powers of granting interdicts and the legal point involved
here, we believe, will bear being taken in appeal to Bloemfontein,
should a similar situation arise again. Meanwhile, it is necessary at any
rate to write to the Government about it.
The second case relates to a decision of Mr. Beans. He has now
left the Immigration Appeal Court. The decision about which we wish
to write was his last one. True, it does justice, but Mr. Beans was not
happy giving it and did not miss having a fling at the community. Mr.
Justice Broome did an injustice in his decision, but showed that he was
not happy doing so. Thus two persons, both occupying seats of
justice, have two different temperaments. The facts of the case decided
by Mr. Beans are simple. The petitioner had a certificate of 1896. He
had been to and returned from India twice with this certificate.
On this third occasion, the officer stopped him on his arrival and so
there was an appeal. Mr. Beans remarked rather gratuitously that the
petitioner was not stating the facts, but lacked the courage to send him
back. How is it possible to send back a man who has been here twice?
For this reason and also because the officer acknowledged that he
[the petitioner] was the one who had taken out the certificate,
Mr. Beans could not give an unfavourable decision. Though giving a
favourable decision, he allowed himself to remark that the officer did
well in stopping him. He went further, and said that, in such cases,
criminal proceedings should be instituted; with that end in view,
he has forwarded all the evidence regarding the petitioner to the
public prosecutor. Such is the terrible position we are in. A
harsh law, administered harshly, and the difficulty of obtaining
redress in the lower courts. All the same, this case, in all likelihood,
will have the result of making it difficult for officers to deport those
who may enter on their own certificates.

57. RIGHTS OF MINORS
There was recently a very important immigration case in
Pretoria. The Immigration Officer refused to admit a Muslim boy. We
shall say nothing here about some odd reasons given by him but only
examine the legal point involved. The reason for refusing admission
was that the boy was born of a marriage celebrated according to the
Muslim faith; since the law does not recognize Muslim marriages, the
children of such marriages could not be admitted. The applicant
wentin appeal against this decision. It came up before the new Board
appointed at Pretoria. The relevant section of the law provides that the
wife and children of a man entitled to be here can come in, and the
persons so entitled to come in will include a wife by a monogamous
marriage recognized in law, and his children. The Court interpreted
this section in favour of the petitioner. Its argument ran as follows:
“True, only a wife whose marriage is recognized by law can come in,
but there is no rule that only her children can enter. Children can
come in, whether the parents are married or not. This will include the
children of a legally married couple. Children of couples living
together without being legally married are not barred.” Following this
argument, the Court gave a decision in favour of the petitioner.
We must not jump to conclusions from this argument of the
Court. It will not carry conviction. If the Court’s argument is correct,
then it will also apply to women. In the relevant section of the law, the
words “wife” and “child” occur at two places. The Court has given
different meanings to the word “child” in the two places, but has
given the same interpretation to the words “wife” at both places. The
Court’s reasons for doing so sound plausible but lack substance. Its
decision, therefore, does not remove our misgivings. If, however, its
interpretation is correct, we must admit that our protests regarding the
position of children in connection with the marriage question will lose
some of their force. Because children born out of wedlock have been
given the right of entry, it does not follow that we have secured all our
rights. The Immigration Officer has not been happy over the decision
of the Court and, therefore, the case will go, at his instance, to the
Supreme Court. Let us see what happens there. That the Immigration
Officer is likely to take this case to a higher court shows that the
Government does not mean well by us. More, it wants to have the laws
interpreted strictly and by adopting such methods to root us out
altogether. It should be realized that we have resorted to satyagraha
64

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

against this state of mind. Our sufferings will not end with one
campaign of satyagraha; we shall have to use this weapon whenever
they become intolerable. If we do so often enough, the Government
will see our strength, will know what our real demands are and give up
its obduracy.
We can see from this case that with the new Appeal Boards
things have improved. We are sure an Appeal Board of the older type
would never have given such a decision. The old Appeal Board at
Pretoria would have acted in the same manner as its counterpart at
Durban in the case of Kulsumbibi.
We hope, in this case, the petitioner will fight in the Supreme
Court with the same skill as he has shown so far. When we say that the
case is not strong, we do not mean that there are no arguments for it.
If the Supreme Court takes up a liberal attitude, it may accept the
arguments advanced in favour of the petitioner, in which case, the
children of all wives will be able to come in. If the decision goes
against us, there will be no need to feel discouraged, for the great fight
on the issue of marriage which we have been carrying on will decide
this question too. We can very well see from this case how big is our
struggle and how many important results it is likely to yield.

58. OUR HOPES
A gentleman writes to us:
This is, indeed, a rare time for you, the like of which will not recur. Circumstances will never again favour you with a similar opportunity, what with the support
India has been giving you and the strong sympathies that have been aroused.
Nothing, therefore, should be left out from the full citizenship rights which are to be
achieved, so that our people may not have to endure hardships again. Besides the
matters in dispute, there are the questions of the right to own land, the Gold Law, the
Township Act, freedom to hold licences in the Transvaal, the franchise, the prohibition on Indians putting up stores on new stations, while the Jews are free to do so,
and reserved compartments in trains being packed with as many as twelve men. There
must be many other matters besides these of which you will be aware. There is, of
course, no need for me to write. I have only mentioned this in passing. All that I
mean is that the present opportunity will not come again and that, therefore, every
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

65

right should be secured.

It is well that we have received this letter. We believe that what
this one gentleman has put in writing is in the minds of many. We
have, however, to say with regret that such hopes will lead to
disappointment. Like everything else, satyagraha has its limits. To
understand how much may be achieved through it is the first step to
success in it. It needs to be understood, once and for all, that the path
of truth is not meant for ends not consistent with truth. It is our belief
that raising our demands will amount to untruthfulness. Many things,
moreover, which can be achieved through satyagraha we shall surely
fail to achieve if we are not uncompromising enough in our regard
for truth. For instance, we should have the right to [own] land in the
Transvaal. But that was not one of our demands in this struggle. We
cannot, therefore, advance it at this stage. The strength that may be
needed to demand the right in future, we do not as yet see in the
community. In the present satyagraha, the indentured Indians have
shaken the world. Inspired by their strength, India resounded with
protests. But we certainly cannot on that strength secure land rights.
For the right to vote, we need to have many things in us without which,
as we believe, the franchise would prove unavailing, even if granted.
We have no doubt in our minds that it will be a long time before we
have the vote. For that India herself will have to wake up, independently of everything else. In the matter of the Gold Law, licences, etc,
provision is made in Section 5. Not that all our grievances in these
matters will disappear by virtue of this Section, but an assurance from
the Government that the laws in regard to them will be reasonably
administered will enable us to build further and obtain redress without
resorting to satyagraha. As regards hardships on railways, we need to
have some grit. If there are already six men in a compartment, the
seventh must display courage. If he demands another compart-ment,
the conductor is bound to provide it. As long as we are prepared to
submit to kicks, there will be men ever ready to deliver them. If a man
does not fight for himself in such matters and is trampled over in
consequence, nothing that we can do will help him. Letters may be
addressed and even assurances that such things will not recur may be
received. The conductors, however,will persist in their autocratic ways.
“The opportunity will not come again, we shall not have a fight
like this in future.” Such things have been said during every
campaign. However, the campaign in 1908 turned out to be on a

larger scale than that of 1907, and the one in 1913 than that of 1908.
More people went to gaol during 1908-11 than during 1907-8. In
1913, the very highest limit was reached. Even so, when the fight
comes again, it will go one better. It is up to us to see that it does.
Even when we have the best of dishes placed before us, we can eat
only according to our capacity. If we eat in excess, we shall get
indigestion and may even die. The same is true of opportunities. The
opportunity of the future will far excel the present one, but only if,
ignoring it, we rest satisfied with our original demands. If we were to
raise our demands ever so little, we are sure we would lose the
sympathy we have both here and in India. “The community may not
have to endure hardships again”—these are words of cowardice. The
community will not acquire stamina except through suffering. Every
step forward is bound to cost some effort. What we have gone through
is not to be looked upon as hardship but as requisite effort. To wish
that one may not have to make any such effort is to desire that
Nature’s law shall cease to function. Never, in the wide world, have we
come across, nor cease to function. Never, in the wide world, have we
come across, nor have we in history read of, an instance of
achievement without effort.
Finally, Indians need to realize in all seriousness that it is the
first principle of satyagraha not to enhance our original demands. The
second principle is that what is obtained by satyagraha can be retained
only by satyagraha. The third principle is that what is attainable by
satyagraha cannot but be achieved and that satyagraha knows no such
word as “defeat”. We are convinced that, if this is understood, no
misconceptions will arise in the community and that it will be able to
make excellent progress.

59. LETTER TO HERMANN KALLENBACH1
February 14, 1914
MY DEAR LOWER HOUSE,

Now that you know the worst about Ritch, you will have to
handle the matter in the gentlest manner possible. If anything is
disclosed apart from my side, you will step in at once and in any event
see to it that you secure control over all the funds that may come in
future. What a tragedy. I do feel like taking you away and both of us
escaping to the jungle. What a snare and delusion this wretched
civilization, in the midst of which you and I are still living and of the
bitter fruit of which we are still tasting! Woe to us if we tarry in it a
minute longer than may be absolutely necessary. Do wind up your
affairs satisfactorily and flee from the tyrant whilst yet there is time.
Do not deceive yourself into the belief that we are saved until we are
quite out of it which we will not be quite even in India all of a sudden.
The Indian visit will be merely a preparation for the glorious future
which must be unalloyed by the poison of the modern craze. Do not
put your trust in money please. You know that you are free to come
to Cape Town whenever you wish to come. Only finish your work
there, both public and private, for there may be no time left after the
legislation in Cape Town.
With love,
Yours,

60. LETTER TO RAOJIBHAI PATEL
[CAPE TOWN ,]

Sunday [After February 15, 1914]
DEAR SHRI RAOJIBHAI,

I must have piled up claims on you in some previous life. Else,
how could I deserve so much love from you? Still, the love that you
showed me in my misfortune yesterday was beyond description. For
this, I pray, may you both grow brighter in your souls. You should
pray, likewise, that having experienced this love [of yours], I may
grow the stronger in my faith in soul-force. If a trivial pledge, none
too important in itself, i.e., the mere undertaking of tapascharya, can
achieve so much, there can be no measuring, as the simple rule of
three will show, how much may be achieved by tapascharya actually
practised. Quite so. Had I not taken the vow, I would not have tasted
pure love as I did; there would have been no speedy discovery of truth
and the poor children would not have been proved innocent as they
actually were.1
Chi. . . . has had to come down from the heights where I had
imagined her to be. Still my mind tells me that she is a blessed soul.
Her virtues are many. It is our duty to develop them. Her action and
her guilt were serious indeed. We should act so as not to remind her of
them. Encourage her to become proficient in household work. See
that none of the children insults her . . . 2 Continue the readings from
holy books in the evenings. I shall hold it to be R’s responsibility to
wake up the children at five . . . 3 See that I have regular news of
Maganbhai’s health.
With due regards

[February 17, 1914] 1
MY DEAR LOWER HOUSE,

We reached yesterday morning without any extra discomfort on
the way. Andrews leaves on Saturday. He has done very wonderful
work here indeed. He has again seen Gladstone, Newman, all the
newspapermen, most of the judges and has been lunching out almost
every day with some notability or other, his main topic of conversation being always India and Tagore or the Indian question here.
Jamnadas is here and two other young Indians who were his
fellow-prisoners. They are all at present being accommodated at
Gool’s place. I am really ashamed to have to be here with Mrs.
Gandhi but he would not hear of my having rooms myself.
Has Ritch returned or have you heard any more about him?

62. ANGLIA’S EVIDENCE
With reference to our criticism, Mr. Anglia writes as follows to
Mr. Gandhi:
I have carefully gone through your comments, in Indian Opinion, on
my evidence. I very much regret that you thought it fit to pass judgment before
publish-ing the full evidence in Gujarati. Was it worthily done? Be that as it
may, I believe that the paper exists for the community, and you claim to serve
the community. If, therefore, you mean to serve it well, you should print the
full text of the evidence in the next issue. You may then make whatever
comments you wish to. Until you reproduce the entire evidence, how can the
public form their own judgment?
1
From the reference to Gandhiji’s being in train (vide fn. to preceding item),
it appears he reached Cape Town on the morning of February 16. This letter was
written the next day and C. F. Andrews left for England on February 21, a Saturday.

70

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

We certainly intend to reproduce the evidence. We took it that
everyone must have read it in the local papers. But we have with us a
verbatim report. We intend to publish in Gujarati the evidence as it
appears in this report so that no injustice is done. We offered our
comments after seeing the report of the evidence in the papers. If,
after going through the verbatim report, we feel like changing our
opinion, we will certainly do so. But we found the evidence as
reported in the papers so bad that we did not think it proper to wait till
we had read the full text. It was our duty to give a timely warning. If
the evidence was not correctly reported in the Press, Mr. Anglia and
Mr. Dada Osman should have sent a correction to the Press. In any
case, we shall, as we have said, write again after going through the full
text of the evidence.

February 18, 1914
MY DEAR LOWER HOUSE,

I had your letter sent to Phoenix redirected. There is no doubt
that Andrews has done most wonderful and ceaseless work. His
address was brilliant and Lord Gladstone made a speech which was
very good. 1 You must have seen it in the papers. I shall send you
copies. As soon as Andrews is gone I would like to send Manilal to
Johannesburg. I am here for a month or more. Whether you come
here or not I think the best thing is for Manilal to stay and work at
Mountain View by himself. But you will have to be fairly strict with
him. He has not gained by his gaol experiences. And you may leave
him only after he is in fairly full swing. But please let me know what
you feel about this. I would like him to come out to Johannesburg as
soon as Andrews is off, subject to your consent. You may, therefore,
wire if you think fit.
With love,

C APE TOWN ,

Maha Vad 12 [February 21, 1914]
DEAR SHRI RAOJIBHAI,

I have your letter. . . . It is not that I wanted Chi. Manilal to be
sent there. He has been removed from the atmosphere of luxury here.
. . . Chi. Jamnadas has been sent there for the same reason. . . . I
believe that one who wants to observe brahmacharya should not dwell
in the midst of luxuries. Ba seems to maintain good health. Be
particular that the boys there become hard-working and that none of
them slackens ever so little in the matter of getting up early. How does
Maganbhai keep? Give me a detailed report. See that Imam Saheb’s
wife does not feel uncomfortable. If any particular article of food is

67. LETTER TO HERMANN KALLENBACH
February 22, 1914
MY DEAR LOWER HOUSE,

I have your two letters and wires. I am glad you were successful
at Pretoria.
Even if Ritch has not finally left Johannesburg, the step he has
taken warrants all my reflections. The contemplated removal to
Mombasa is the act of a mad man. And his sudden departure without
any consultation with anybody is undoubtedly lunacy. The use of the
£500 is willful misappropriation. The use of my money was
legitimate. The inability to reply was capable of being understood or
at least explained away.
I did not wait for wire regarding Manilal. I found that he must
leave Cape Town. The atmosphere was enervating for both the boys.
Both Manilal and Jamnadas therefore left today, Manilal for Johannesburg and Jamnadas for Durban. They both interrupt their journey at Kimberley. Manilal, therefore, reaches you on Wednesday
morning. There is nothing too wrong with the boy but he needs a
calmer and quieter atmosphere which Mountain View will provide.
When you find that Manilal has regained his balance and may be
safely left alone, I presume, you will come here if your business allows
it.
Miss Moonsamy1 , a passive resister girl, is dead. I hope you have
been to see her people and consoled them.
Our friend Habib Motan is here making all the mischief he can.
Mr. Andrews has continued to remain a rare man to me. He got a

atmosphere in a wonderful manner. His affection for the poet1 is
phenomenal. He called him his Guru at the University lecture which
was a treat2 . More when we meet. I am longing to have early morning
walks with you on Table Mountains and sleep on the roof of the
house quite in the open.

DEAR MISS. MOLTENO,

My impression is that I said we would call on you tomorrow
(Tuesday), but Dr. Gool 3 does not remember. Not to make any
mistake we shall be coming there between 3 and 4 tomorrow and take
our chance.
The visit to Miss Hobhouse was entirely successful. It was a
perfect pilgrimage for me. Mrs. Botha4 was all you described her. She
was most kind to both of us and most loving towards Mrs. Gandhi.
Thank you for all this. Incidentally, we met Lady Gladstone too &? 5
Are you not pleased?
With our regards to you and Miss Greene,

DEAR MISS. MOLTENO,

I am sorry to have to inform you that Mrs. Gandhi has had a
relapse and she is at the time of writing lying in bed. She wants me
therefore to say that whilst she would try her best to keep the
appointment for tomorrow, she might not be able to go out at all. I
thought that I should let you know this. In any case I shall expect
you tomorrow afternoon and we shall be able to discuss. If she is very
ill, I would also have to remain in to be by her side. It is a great pity

MY DEAR LOWER HOUSE,

I have your letter enclosing Ramdas’s and others’. You may
well want to treasure Ramdas’s letter. It is a gem. The boy seems to be
shaping beautifully. If the composition is his own, it is also good.
Thambi is now there. Please collar him and pacify him. Mrs. Gandhi
is better but she has ups and downs and continues to cause anxiety.
Imam is doing good work. We have not come here a moment too
soon. Mrs. Gandhi and I went over to see Miss Hobhouse. We saw
there Mrs. Botha and Lady Gladstone. Miss Hobhouse has a divine
face. Have never seen a diviner face. Gokhale by his features took me
by storm. Miss Hobhouse has done likewise, only more so. I feel like
gazing at her in awe for hours.

The above was found among my papers. I knew I had mislaid

creditable document and a complete vindication of our position.

72. LETTER TO RAOJIBHAI PATEL
C APE TOWN ,

Maha Vad 30 [February 24, 1914] 1
DEAR FRIEND,

Your letter about J, I have sent on to Doctor and the one about
M, I destroyed after reading. Putting that letter in his hand might, I
thought, have the wrong effect on him. Now I feel, however, that you
should communicate these views to him direct. I have formed a very
bad impression about him. It seemed to me that, if he were to read
your letter, he would be angry with you and would run into sin, and
that would have been a state far worse than you have described. I
thought later whether or no I should send it on to him and in the end
decided as above.
It is beyond all doubt that, if we keep back anything from one
whom we trust or give a false impression on about us, we would come
to not good. And so J’s and . . .’s sins have been regarded as heinous.
It is because of their extreme hypocrisy that they could be guilty of
such [sins]. If they had no mind to deceive, they would, after they had
turned into beasts under the urge of passion, have soon become
human beings again and stopped pursuing pleasure. One seems now
to be back on the right path and the other caught in the toils of desire
and given over to hypocrisy.

73. IN MEMORIAM
In another column we record the lamented death of yet another
martyr to the passive resistance cause. Miss Valliamah Moonsamy, a
young lady not yet in her twenties, was one of those devoted Indian
women who sought imprisonment in protest against a marriage law
that dishonoured her parents’ marriage and cast a stigma upon
herown birth. Her sudden and unexpected demise, two days after her
return home, holds in it all the elements of tragedy. We mourn the loss
of a noble daughter of India who did her simple duty without
question, and who has set an example of womanly fortitude, pride and
virtue that will, we are sure, not be lost upon the Indian community.
We tender to her family our most respectful sympathy.
Indian Opinion, 25-2-1914

74. UNTIMELY DEATH OF A YOUNG PASSIVE RESISTER
It is with extreme regret we announce the death of Miss
Valliamah, the eldest daughter of Mr. R. Moonsamy Moodaliar of
Johannesburg, on the 22nd instant at Johannesburg, after a prolonged
illness in gaol. It appears that she was taken to bed immediately after
her conviction, and also after her release was suffering greatly. The
late Miss Valliamah was born in Johannesburg in 1898 and attended
the Government School. She joined the passive resistance struggle on
the 29th October last and proceeded to Newcastle with a party of
ladies. She afterwards rendered assistance at Charlestown, Dundee,
Ladysmith, Dannhauser, Maritzburg, Tongaat and Durban. She
eventually re-crossed the Transvaal border and was convicted, with her
mother and others, at Volksrust on the 22nd of December 1913, to
three months’ imprisonment with hard labour and was discharged on
the 11th instant in terms of the Provisional Agreement
Her father is one of the pioneer Indian settlers of the Transvaal.
He was once in gaol as a passive resister and during the last campaign
was very ill and only came out of the hospital where he underwent an
operation recently. We share the sorrows of the parents and express
our deepest sympathy at their irreparable loss.

7 BUITENSINGLE,
C APE TOWN ,

February 25, 1914
MY DEAR LOWER HOUSE,

I fear that my letter written to you yesterday has either
beendestroyed through mistake or enclosed in a letter to Polak.1 For I
see Ramdas’s letter before me and I thought I would post your letter
myself after dinner, which I did not do. I do not know what is going
to happen to Mrs. Gandhi. She hovers between life and death. Her
appetite seems to be coming to her. But she has again developed the
ominous swellings which frightened Dr. Gool who asked to examine
her urine. His examination has led to no results. And the swelling
persists. He is a good man. He never interferes.
Solomon has undergone his operation but he is causing anxiety,
so Polak wires. He is receiving best attention.
What is happening just now is that I am becoming a society man
and Miss Molteno is the instrument. She insists on introducing Mrs.
Gandhi and me to all the families she knows. Yesterday, we went to the
great Estate of the Moltenos and met several people. That is the nature
of work just now. She is undoubtedly a tactful peacemaker.
Sir Benjamin continues consciously or unconsciously to cause
mischief. He is now in league with Habib Motan, whom I saw with our
friend Nooruddin and Morris Alexander of Johannesburg coming out
of Sir Benjamin’s office as I went in.
Manilal must be there now. I hope you will try to be with him as
much as you can. If he remains morose I suggest your taking him
with you to your office and using him for office work in so far as you
may and can. I should like you to take your meal with him for the
time being.
You will be agreeably surprised to know that my eldest brother2
who used always to go strongly against me has now completely
changed and repents of his past letters and thinks that I have not

Phagan Sud 2, 1970 [February 26, 1914]
CHI. JAMNADAS,

I see that you and Manilal have for once failed to understand
me. Had I thought that it was for your good to keep you, I would not
have sent you away merely to serve my convenience. I could not have
fought against the atmosphere here. You have no idea of how subtle
its effect can be. . . 1 I noted Dr. Gool’s priceless worth long before
any of you did. However, just as I recognize similar worth in you and
yet consider you weak and mere children, and would hesitate to place
anyone under your charge, much in the same way I would hesitate to
place innocent youths like you under Dr. Gool’s influence. Dr. Gool
himself knows that he is a mere child. He knows his shortcomings too
and that is the reason he has kept his own brother away from him. . .
.is rash and passionate. I do not want to see such rashness and passion
in you. You have not acquired the discrimination of the swan2 . If you
had, there would have been no occasion for me to criticize you so
harshly. You have found my excess of love scorching on this
occasion. That happens. Calm yourself down, though. I have not acted
without thinking. You are wrong in charging me with arguing like a
lawyer. Once before also you said this. I find from experience that I
possess in an especial degree the gift of analysis and of discriminating
right from wrong and, in the result, my nice arguments sound like
special pleading to others. All the same, you may unhesitatingly say
whatever you wish to in self-defence or with a view to putting me
right. That is your duty. I insist on your continuing to write to me. Ba

. . . 2 You have sinned, without knowing it, in charging me with
cruelty. How could I have grown cruel in fifteen days? I have given
no such impression to others. Nothing of the sort happened in
Phoenix. I have grown very tender to Ba, as she has observed. If I
turned cruel to you, what little goodness I claim would be no more
than a show and I would think that my life had been wasted.
But I shall no doubt appear cruel to you at present. . . .3 The veil
of ignorance which prevented me from seeing the same veil over you
has vanished, leaving only pure love. This love appears cruel to you
for the time being, for, like a physician, I must make you swallow
bitter draughts. . . . 4 I have grown impatient to help you. . .5 to
become perfect. Impatience is my weakness. To the extent that I am
impatient, I am but a fond lover. I have fondness enough in me yet to
make me attached to you for being my son. When that has gone, even
the cruelty that you think you see in me you will see no more.
Meanwhile, please bear with me.
And now for the contradictions in your letter. For three days
you did not [as you say] go out to see Cape Town because of my
harsh words. And yet, when leaving, you expressed a desire to do so,
though I was in a rage. The harsh words had been there, even on
Sunday. Believing that I was cruel, how could you hope to learn
anything by living with me? You showed yourself very keen on

much more, what did you find in that to take offence?
Well, what has happened has happened. It is your duty not to
take notice of my faults. A son should have devotion enough to his
father not to notice his shortcomings but to think only of his virtues. I
should like to see this trustfulness in you. I don’t want to make an
ascetic of you. I want to see your character pure, to see in you
truthfulness, chastity, straightforwardness, tenderness, self-confidence,
humility and goodness. I want to see you indifferent to the
commonpleasures of the world. I doubt, however, if you have these at
present. I am not asking you to start doing immediately everything I
do. But I want you to understand my deepest feelings and so attain
true success in your life.

February 27, 1914
MY DEAR LOWER HOUSE,

Why very Low House? I see nothing wrong in your letter
regarding food. I have seen nobody who has been able to deny
himself so much of the world’s good things of life as you have. And
what does it matter if you have been taking macaroni about which you
have so satisfied yourself. Indeed if you went back to rice and
tomatoes, I should not worry. I would certainly like you not to go
back to vegetables. But your dissatisfaction is that you have been
obliged to discuss your food so much. We are food reformers and so
we cannot help it. When our reform becomes part of our nature, we
shall cease to discuss it. If I discuss it less than you do (which I doubt)
it must be because mine has become more natural to me than yours to
you. Though I love and almost adore Andrews so, I would not
exchange you for him. You still remain the dearest and the nearest to
me and so far as my own selfish nature is considered I know that in

my lonely journey through the world, you will be the last (if even
that) to say good-bye to me. What right had I to expect so much from
you!
Now about Manilal. I have given you some idea. He and
Jamnadas appeared to me unbalanced. They did the very things that
they used to criticize in others. For instance, they give themselves
every indulgence that they denied themselves at Phoenix. If Hanif
too[k] something outside Phoenix, both of them used to bring it to
my notice. In spite of Manilal’s sad experience, both took the greatest
freedom with the girls. They [were] surrounded with much attention
and love from all the members of the family. Dr. Gool who is such a
noble soul but yet youthful, made a deep impression on them by his
suave nature. The result was that the boy’s faculty for thinking, study
or work was paralysed. They rose after 6 a.m. They never studied.
Their talk seemed to me to be unnatural. They found themselves
placed in gaudy surroundings which unhinged them for the moment.
I felt that to give them a month of this life would be to hurt two very
sensitive young promising plants. I spoke very sharply and bitterly to
them. They have resented my tone and my speech as also my action.
The discovery I made on arrival was so shocking that I certainly
became impatient. But I am sorry neither for my action nor for my
speech. I had a right to expect them not to misunderstand me. After
all I have sent them away to my personal discomfort and for their
advantage. My presence in their midst could not have counterbalanced the unperceived mischief that was working its way into their
system. Jamnadas must therefore naturally go to Phoenix and Manilal
not to Phoenix whilst Jeki is there and that when I am away. The only
alternative for him was to be at Mountain View where he can do the
right thing just to the extent that he is able. I wished to place both in
circumstances most favourable to their spiritual growth. I have advised
Manilal that he ought to religiously avoid baker’s bread, tea and
coffee and that he should rarely go to Town, never eat the Town food
and never sleep in Town. But I have told him he is a free agent. He
need only adopt that part of my advice which appeals to him and no
more. I do not want him to do anything for my sake. I want him to
become not a creeper but a vigorous tree.
I had another glorious interview with Miss Hobhouse yesterday.
We discussed you fairly fully and I have told her that it is likely you
might be here whilst I am also here. She is General Smuts’ guest

helpful.
Will you select a tablet for the two deceased. Valliamma’s death
I felt most keenly. My first disappointment was that not a single
Gujarati had died. Even I was left alive when those that did not want to
die had gone. I then became conceited and felt that those that had
died had done so because they had lived a most unnatural life. If
anybody should have died it was Mrs. Gandhi. There is no guarantee
even now that she will live. But she seems to be rallying and would
certainly have succumbed under the orthodox treatment. And yet the
desire in me to die is overpowering. I am unable to stare a Tamil in
the face when I recall these deaths. It is weakness I know. But it is
there. Consult Naidoo about the stone, please, and both can be put on
when I am passing through Johannesburg. I should be delighted.

79. LETTER TO G. K. GOKHALE
C APE TOWN ,

February 27, 1914
DEAR MR. GOKHALE,

For the time being I am at Cape Town watching the course of
events. I do not want to inflict on you any news about the struggle. I
shall be as brief as I possibly can.
Mr. Andrews and Mr. Pearson are truly good men, we all like
them very much. Sir Benjamin has disappointed us. He has hardly
done any good and he may do a great deal of harm. He is weak and
by no means sincere. Even now he has hardly grasped the details. And
he undoubtedly, consciously or unconsciously, fosters divisions
among us. Mr. Andrews will tell you all about him. But I thought that
I should give you my impressions of Sir Benjamin.
If there is a settlement in March, I propose to leave for India in
April. I shall have with me probably about 20 men, women and
children who will live with me. These will include the school children
who are likely to come. I do not know whether you still want me to
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

85

live at the Servants of India quarters in Poona or how. I shall be
prepared to do so immediately after I have paid a visit to the members
of my family. It is likely that the number living with me may be
augmented by some members of my family who may wish to share
my life and work. Please do not consider yourself bound to keep me
at the Society’s quarters. I am entirely in your hands. I want to learn
at your feet and gain the necessary experience. No matter whether
I am staying somewhere under your guidance or not, I shall scrupulously observe the compact of silence for one year after my arrival in
India. The vow of silence as I have understood it does not include the
South African question and may be broken at your wish for furthering any project about which both of us hold the same view.
My present ambition you know. It is to be by your side as your nurse
and attendant. I want to have the real discipline of obeying someone
whom I love and look up to. I know I made a bad secretaryin South
Africa. I hope to do better in the Motherland if I am accepted.
May you benefit in health by the change and the calmer
atmosphere on the continent.
This letter will be in your hands about the middle of March. If
you deem it necessary to say anything to me about my movements,
you will of course cable. I assume too that you will not want me to go
to Poona before you return. If you did, I should of course go.
If I am enabled to leave for India in April, I propose to use the
funds you have sent for our passages which shall be all deck. I have
no means of my own and Phoenix can hardly supply funds now. It is
drained totally dry.
I remain,
Yours sincerely,

[CAPE TOWN ,]

Phagan Sud 3, 1970 [February 28, 1914]
CHI. JAMNADAS,

There is no telegram from you, and no letter either, except one;
it looks as if you are angry. Your letter from Kimberley was not well
considered. Having seen, however, that your conduct itself, while you
were here, was defiant, why should I complain about a letter? The
letters from both of you indicate that Cape Town has been no healthy
influence on you. . . .1 Why is it that in Phoenix I did not get
exasperated by anyone’s conduct? I forget, there was one exception,
Miss Schlesin. But she could realize her mistakes in the end. In the
beginning she gave me nothing but trouble. You two, on the other
hand, started pointing out my faults. I hope you will think the matter
over and calm down. I am not writing to Manilal today. Please,
therefore, send this on to him.

by yourself because fathers did not like your ways. You should realize
that in releasing you from attendance on Ba and asking you to go,

without thinking of my personal convenience, I must have acted with
the purest of love. More than your services, I want good behaviour
from you. If you become so good that you will never make a slip, I
should ask for no more. I would tell Ba too that it was as well you had
left. For the last four days I have been seeing that there is meat on the
table thrice a day. I manage to finish my meals earlier since I have
changed the hours. It hurt me very much yesterday to have to see all
that meat in front of me and I simply did not know what to do. I have
now decided that, as far as possible, my meal-hours shall not be the
same as theirs. They are not at fault in this matter. They tell me quite
frankly [that I can fix my own hours]. Formerly, I was not sensitive
about this. It is only now that I am growing so. This sensitiveness on
my part is a good sign. At the same time they are not to be blamed for
having all these things prepared. But I would certainly not wish you to
be placed in such surroundings. But for Ba being with me, I would
touch none of the preparations. At present, all sorts of things are
being prepared. They have bun and also jam; and even ground-nut is
cooked. Of course, this is not the reason for my sending you away.
But having regard to this as well, I think it is good you have left. So
long as Mr. Andrews was here, he acted as a shield for you, but they
would not have desisted from meat-preparations on your account.
Your going away can do you nothing but good. If you are keen on
serving Ba or me, you will certainly have the opportunity to do so.
That will be only when you are earnest in your desire, or when,
wanting your services out of our pure selfishness, I spoil you. This can
never be, so that your serving [us] depends entirely on the effort you
make. Consider the full meaning of this letter and ponder over it. Do
not be angry with father.

Sunday [March 1, 1914]
MY DEAR LOWER HOUSE,

Mrs. Gandhi wanted medicine. She had it in the mildest form
from Dr. Gool and she is now laid up with fever, aches all over and
pain in the stomach. The crisis may have been coming and the
medicine may have nothing to do with this serious relapse. Anyhow
the latter is there and there is no escaping it. For her death will be the
finest deliverance. But we are in God’s hands. Let His will and not
ours be done. I am by her side day and night. I commenced today
reading the Ramayana to her. She cannot listen longer than hour. Yet
it is something. You may need this to Manilal. There is no cause for
anxiety. And he need not fret. She is certainly most resigned and has
commenced fasting again.
I am drying some bananas for you. It is an experiment. This is
not for bread but for stew which will be substantial and not sweet. We
must perpetuate Valliamma’s memory. Can you suggest anything?
Confer with Naidoo and others.
With love,
Yours,

85. LETTER TO KHUSHALCHAND GANDHI
[CAPE TOWN ,]

Phagan Sud 4 [March 1, 1914]
RESPECTED KHUSHALBHAI,

How could I help being happy beyond words that, in deference
to my wish, you have sent on Jamnadas also? He has conducted
himself in gaol in the same spirit that moved him to come over here.
The courage and presence of mind he displayed when going to gaol
and while in gaol, few others could have shown in their first
experience. I can recall no such instance at the moment. Jamnadas
behaved as though he had already gone through the mill. This shows
that he had lived in thought through the experience of others and
profited by it. Many people learn nothing unless they themselves
suffer; but I have observed that Jamnadas has the gift [of learning
from the experience of others]. His habit of thinking too much has an
unsettling effect on him, but I believe this will disappear in course of
time. He keeps well enough.
About the question of his marriage, it would be better, I think, to
talk over the matter when we meet instead of my expressing an
opinion right now. I have understood your point. After considering
all the circumstances, we shall take whatever step we may decide on. I
think Chi. Narandas1 should be able to meet all your special
requirements. It should be enough for you to have one son to attend
on you, if that is what you want. This too I should like to discuss
personally with you when we meet there. Provided a settlement comes
off, I hope to start April. Should the struggle start again, there will be
nothing to think about. Jamnadas must, in that case, go through it. I
have seen in him a courageous spirit which I should be very happy
indeed to bring out. I see that all your sons have it in them to be
ornaments to the family, to the community and to the whole world.
From among them all, Jamnadas may even prove to be the best, thanks
to his karma 2 . And naturally too. He is the youngest of the four, and
so, when the two of you drew his life into being, your spiritual
state had attained full maturity and Jamnadas, too, would have that
maturity. He has also the advantage of several other circumstances

denied to his three brothers 1 . All these, however, are my conjectures.
Our duty in the matter is to encourage and develop whatever good we
observe in our children. The rest must depend on the working out of
their prarabdha 2 .
You have two daughters-in-law, at any rate, of the same calibre
as your sons. Having known Kashi and Santok, I have always felt that
I have been granted such tender-hearted children because of some
former good deeds of mine. They have spared no pains to meet my
wishes and have made my work here very easy.
As if fortune had not favoured me enough already, respected
Kalabhai3 also wants to entrust his son to me. I am not the one to fight
shy of accepting additional responsibilities, and my conscience tells
me that I have perfect faith in God.
With deepest regards from

inspire no fear. It seems that a man does not suffer excessively even
when he is burnt to death. When the pain becomes unbearable, he
loses consciousness. Those who cling to the body so very tenaciously
only suffer the more. One who knows the truth about the atman will
have no fear of death. Thousands of men, thousands of creatures, are
burnt to death, like Nepal, every moment now. In the universe, Nepal
is an infinitely smaller creature than even an ant. How many creatures,
relatively bigger than Nepal, do we not burn away, knowingly or
otherwise, in making fires or using lights at night?
Imagine a being of immense size like Brahma1 . To him, we must
be smaller than ants. The very size of his eyes must be so large that we
would look like fleas. What if Nepal has been burnt to death by a
creature like this? He might have even believed that he might burn
away a creature like Nepal for the happiness of a great being such as
he was. To us, Nepal is a creature of our size, so that we pity him,
afraid of what we might suffer in similar circumstances. But the
argument we use in our wisdom about creatures like the ant, the bug,
the flea and other countless insects invisible to our naked eye, must be
the very argument applied to us by the much wiser Brahma. If we can
understand this, we may learn the following lessons from the case of
Nepal and others of the kind:
1. We should have compassion on ourselves as on all creatures,
looking on them as one, and draw back in alarm from destruction of
life for any purpose of ours.
2. We should cherish no fond attachment for the body and have no
fear whatever of death.
3. We should strive for moksha right now, knowing that the body is all
too apt to let us down.
It is very easy to utter these three maxims but it is difficult to
ponder over them and, after pondering, it is like walking on a sword
blade to put them into practice.
It is morning now. My ideas flow in this direction, for Ba is in
pain again and I am trying to free her from the fear of death.
With due regards

anger, had paused to think, had looked round, things would not have

would not be misled by anyone, would not follow the example of

89. LETTER TO HARILAL GANDHI
[CAPE TOWN ,]

Phagan Sud 5 [March 2, 1914] 1
CHI. HARILAL,

I have your letter. You apologize in every letter of yours and
put up a defence as well. It all seems to me sheer hypocrisy now. For
years, you have been slack in writing letters, and then coming
forward with apologies. Will this go on till death, I forgiving every
time? And what is the point of my forgiving? Forgiving has a
meaning only to the extent that the person who has apologized does
not err again. My forgiving you all the time means that I should go
on doing my duty as father though you may not do yours as son. My
duty, of course, I shall continue to do according to my judgment. I
don’t believe that you are impatient to see us both; equally, this idea
that you were to come here sounds insincere to me. Does one who
really means to come trumpet it aloud? Now, of course, your coming
is pointless, as you say. I see that your ideas and mine differ very
much. Your conception of your duty as son differs from mine, but I
have no right to enquire what your duty is. If you go on doing your
duty as you in all sincerity conceive it to be, I shall be perfectly
satisfied. Whether your idea of duty is sincere or not, I and others will
be able to judge from your actions. It seems you have also applied
your mind to what my duty is, and in this respect, too, our ideas differ.

It should be for me to consider what my duty is. You may,
nevertheless, continue to tell me what you think.
I did not reply to your letter. I got it after my release from gaol.
Your suggestions, however, were carried out; that is, I wrote to
Revashankerbhai that he should have a talk with you and give you
more [money] as may seem necessary.
You want my advice regarding Chanchi, and also about your
studies. You violate all the conditions I had made and you promised
to fulfil. You were asked never to go in for studies at the cost of your
health. You have failed to take care of it. No wonder that Ramdas and
Manilal have outdone you. And Ramdas has put in a fine effort,
indeed, and grown in size as well. Manilal, too, has plenty of strength
and would have been stronger yet if he had not taken to the evil ways
of pleasure. Even their studies I take to be sounder than yours. Your
mind is now running after Bombay. You say you have Revashankerbhai’s consent for that. What weight can that consent carry with me? I
would submit in all humility to Revashankerbhai’s judgment of a
diamond. How could I listen to him in the matter of studies? You are,
so it seems to me, in a state of stupefaction. What, then, am I to say?
You can only think of Davar’s classes. That simply stuns me. Do you
think it will be much of an achievement to pass the matriculation
examination? I do not even understand what it is that you want to do.
I would only advise you to do nothing. Wait till my return. Meanwhile, read as you like. Do not, however, start a new venture. Later,
you may talk things over with me, but only if you want to.
If, indeed, you wish to go ahead with your plan for studies, you
should have Chanchi stay with me and should yourself stay away from
me. I shall supply your needs. Think of Chanchi when you turn your
mind to earning. If you wish to live as I want you to, stay with me and
be my right hand. Use your own judgment in all these matters, taking
no thought of my personal inclinations. Weighing my advice against
that of others, do what you think best. I am a father who is prejudiced
against you. I do not approve of your ways at all. I doubt whether you
have any love for us. This statement sounds very harsh, but I see
extreme insincerity in your letters. If I am mistaken in this, consider
that I am in Kurukshetra1 and so forgive me, showing me the

trouble to remember to send this year’s either. I become angry when
writing to you and also feel like crying. This is my ignorant state, my
lack of enlightenment. I ought not to be so much attached to you. I
will free myself from this. Be patient with me till I succeed.
Now I have given you too long a lesson. I will write no more. I

due to a friend. I want you to improve your character and train your
inner self.
I will probably go there in April. Just now I am in Cape Town.
Ba is with me. She lies hanging between life and death. Till yesterday,
she was very bad indeed. There is again a little improvement. She is a
mere skeleton. She gives me no trouble, but, not having succeeded yet
in disciplining the palate, she suffers and pines. I am by her side the
whole day. Between yesterday and today, she must have consumed the
juice of two tomatoes and a teaspoonful of oil.

DEAR SIR BENJAMIN,

It strikes me that, with reference to Mr. Polak’s note, I should
mention perhaps the manner in which relief can be granted in the
several matters.

Immigration. Relief can be easily given in the administration of
this Act, as there is one Act applicable to all the Provinces and it can
be done by altering the regulations in the desired direction.
Inter-provincial visiting and travelling permits should be granted for
the asking and either without a deposit or with a small deposit and no
more than a shilling stamp to cover the bare cost.
Certificates of identity should be of a permanent duration even
as the Transvaal certificates are—why should the Transvaal have an
advantage over the other Provinces in these matters?
The question of the withdrawal and return of children should be
definitely fixed.
Proof required from wives who would be administratively
admitted should be definitely stated. Indeed, it is necessary to go
through the regulations clause by clause with Mr. Gorges and then
discuss them with General Smuts.
Dealers’ Licences. This is a difficult question. The three
Provinces have three different laws and they are not administered
directly by the Union Government. The control is partly in the hands
of the Provincial Governments and partly in those of the municipalities. Each municipality has its own policy and bye-laws. The utmost
that can be done is for the Government to address circulars to the
responsible bodies warning them of the danger of following a sweeping policy. This method was successfully adopted by the late Mr.
Escombe1 who was himself the author of the Natal licensing law of
1896. And the local administrations will not fail to note the changed
attitude of the Union administration if it ever changes for the better.
The Transvaal Gold Laws. In this the Union Government can
give definite relief by accepting the meaning that I have ventured to
give to the expression ‘vested rights’ which they have promised in
their dispatches to respect. By ‘vested rights’ I understand the right of
the Indian and his successors to live and trade in the township he was
living in and trading, no matter how often he shifts his residence or
business from place to place in the same township.
Law of 1885 Transvaal. The Government can safely and easily
administer the Law in a liberal or, rather, just spirit by granting the

benefit of a freehold title in Locations or Wards fixed under the Law.
In this connection I would state that it would be a most dangerous
thing for the Government to de-proclaim old established Locations.
Education. The Government have sadly neglected this matter.
The wretched schools in Natal and the few at the Cape and the Transvaal serve no useful purpose. The vernaculars are neglected and Indians are becoming dis-Indianised, without becoming Europeanised in
the proper sense.
Future admissions. The number of future admissions of new
men needed for the wants of the community has not yet been fixed
save for the Transvaal. I have suggested at least 40 for the Union. This
is far below the average of the past five years.
Every one of these points is covered by the 5th clause of the
Passive Resistance declaration.1 They can hardly be tackled by the
Commission. But, in my humble opinion, they can be best dealt with
by a full discussion between you and General Smuts. The whole
weight of the Government of India will have to be used in our behalf
if real peace is to be enjoyed by the Indians of South Africa and the
Viceroy so far as the S. A. question is concerned.
May I trouble you to send me a copy of this letter? I have no

MY DEAR LOWER HOUSE,

I propose sending Polak to Johannesburg to take charge of the
practice there. Ritch finished, you and I in India and Polak in
England, why, the thing is inconceivable. And the whole structure
must topple over. I have, therefore, suggested that Polak should take
up Johannesburg as headquarters and not go to England for the time
being. And he and she have most loyally accepted the proposal. I

have suggested too that Mrs. Polak should go to England leaving
Polak alone here. But she does not cherish the idea. They should rent
Mountain View from you and live there. I do not know what they will
do. At the same time I do not know whether [the] proposition is a
suitable one for you. It must be a business proposition this time. We
are princes and just now we must spend money in a princely style.
There is no need, therefore, for me to ask you to give me Mountain
View. On the contrary, I am thinking of your own dispositions in this
connection. If Mountain View can be sold or a better tenant can be
found, you need not think of Polak. The proposal has to suit you
both.

92. LETTER TO MANILAL GANDHI
[CAPE TOWN ,]

Wednesday, Phagan Sud 7 [March 4, 1914]
CHI. MANILAL,

I have your letter. You ought not to have hidden from me the
fact that you lost the tin of water. Just think how much care I take
even in regard to such things and take a lesson from it. But that lesson
you will take only if you lay open your heart before me. You will not
be able to learn anything so long as you try to hide your mistakes
from me, even for a moment. Be sure that hiding or secrecy is a form
of untruth, which is like poison in the system. A poison turns other
healthy substances also into poison. Even a grain of arsenic is enough
to render milk unfit for drinking. Insist on getting up at 4 a. m.
always. If it is very cold, sit in the house, cover yourself liberally but
do get up early. You may go to bed as early as you like; I do not
mind that.
As regards food, you may have three meals a day if you feel the
necessity. You need not control yourself in the matter of taking food.
It is enough if you observe some rules regarding the articles of food.
Ba is somewhat better today; but still the crisis is not over. She is

93. LETTER TO DEVDAS GANDHI
[CAPE TOWN ,]

Phagan Sud 8, 1970 [March 5, 1914]
CHI. DEVDAS 1 ,

Improve your handwriting. Ba’s condition has grown very bad
of late. She and I both believe that medical treatment has had altogether an adverse effect on her. She herself had asked for such treatment. After she had had two or three doses, her condition became
serious. She can eat no food at present. She took a few grapes
yesterday, but it seems they did not agree with her. Even if the end is
death, we have made up our minds to have no fear of it. You need not
worry, therefore. The body is sure to fall, and that, on the appointed
day. Remedies occur to us accordingly. The atman, besides, is
immortal and, though we seem to be concerned only with the body,
our real concern should be for the atman. For a truth, we don’t
preserve the body for any length of time after the soul has left it. So
thinking, I take the necessary measures for Ba’s health and then stop
worrying, and I would ask you all to do the same. Realizing, then, the
fate of the body, we should cultivate goodness2 and disinterestedness.
Goodness does not mean outward indifference to objects of desire or
a wandering life, but purity of character. Disinterestedness does not
mean gloominess but aversion to the pleasures of the senses and
absence of interest in the things of this world. If you learn this during
Ba’s illness, that will be evidence, indeed, of your true devotion to her.

C APE TOWN ,

March 6, 1914
DEAR SIR BENJAMIN,

You will see from the enclosed that every result feared from the
Searle judgment is being brought about by the very action of the
Government. The original case is reported in Indian Opinion. 1 But I
send you the Pretoria News cutting. I was waiting for the Supreme
Court decision. This was invited, as you will observe, by the
Government. Now the Highest Court has reversed the decision of the
Lower Court and the children of de facto monogamous unions [are]
declared illegitimate and, therefore, prohibited immigrants. Now, such
children and the children of wives to be administratively allowed to
enter the Union are to be protected under the proposed settlement.
Will you kindly go into this matter and secure, pending settlement, the
non-deportation of the child? As I am writing to you, I am not myself
writing to the Government in this matter.
May I ask you please to let me have copies of this and my
previous letter?2
I am,

96. LETTER TO RAOJIBHAI PATEL
C APE TOWN ,

Phagan Sud 10 [March 7, 1914]
DEAR SHRI RAOJIBHAI,

I read and re-read your letter. Shankaracharya has a verse which
says that more patience and time are required for disciplining the
mind, that is, attaining moksha, than is needed by a man who, sitting
on the shore, would empty the ocean of all its water drop by drop with
a blade of grass. You seem to be in too great a hurry.
I have not got rid of the fear of death, despite much thinking.
But I feel no impatience. I keep on trying and I am sure I shall get rid
of it one day. We should not let go a single occasion when we may
try. That is our duty. It is for God to produce or will the result. Why
worry then? When feeding her baby, the mother has no thought of the
result. The result does follow, though. To get rid of the fear of death
and to drive away desire, make the effort and keep cheerful ; and they
will disappear. Otherwise, it will be the same with you as with the man
who, resolving not to think about a monkey, kept on thinking of one.
We are born in sin, and we are enslaved in the body, because of
our sinful deeds; how can you hope to cleanse yourself of all the
impurity just in a minute?
You may live as you like,
Realize God anyhow.
This is the teaching of Akha Bhagat1 . Tulsidasji says:

Whether in adversity or no, repeat over and over again the
name of Rama and you will achieve all there is to be achieved.
This is the end we must aim at. Therefore, go on repeating that
name. Be clear in your mind who this Rama is. He is unconditioned,
formless. Armed with the countless virtues that belong to the godly
nature, He destroys Ravana, representing a host of monstrous
desires. He practised penance for 12 years to earn this strength.
Finally, do not allow your body or mind to remain idle even for a
moment. Keep both cheerfully engaged; if you do this, all your
troubles are bound to vanish. For the rest, have faith in God; your
depending on me will be in vain. This faith will be to some purpose
only after you have done what I have advised.
If the heart is pure, the grosser impulses of the body will have
no scope. But what do we mean by the heart? And when may we
believe the heart to be pure? The heart is nothing else but the atman
or the seat of the atman. To imagine that it is pure is to imply perfect
realization of the atman and, in the presence of such realization, the
cravings of the senses are inconceivable. But ordinarily we attribute
purity to the heart when we are but striving after such purity. Say, I
love you. This only means that I try to cultivate such a feeling for
you. If I have unceasing love, I should be a perfectly enlightened
man, which, indeed, I am not. Anyone for whom I have true love will
not misunderstand my intentions or words, nor will such a one bear
ill-will to me. It follows from this that, when anyone looks upon us as
his enemy, the fault is primarily ours. This is also true of our relations
with the whites. Perfect purity of heart, therefore, is the final stage.
Before we have reached that stage, as we advance towards greater and
greater purity, the cravings of the senses will subside in corresponding
measure. These cravings do not originate in the senses.
The mind alone is the cause of man’s being bound or free.1
The senses are the points at which the impulses in the mind
become manifest. Through them we come to recognize the impulses
as such.
And so, by destroying the senses, we do not do away with the
impulses in the mind. Eunuchs, as we observe, are full of desires.
Those who are such by birth are so full of them that they have been
known to be guilty of unnatural acts. I am deficient in the sense of
1

smell; even so, I feel the desire to enjoy fragrance, so much so that,
when I find anyone talking about the fragrance of the rose or other
flowers, the mind, like the donkey, immediately runs after it and is
held back with the greatest difficulty.
We have heard of men who, passionate in their convictions, cut
off their organs when they found it impossible to control their minds.
It may possibly be one’s duty to do so in such circumstances.
Supposing my mind becomes a prey to desire and I cast an evil eye
on my sister, I am burning with lust but have not been totally blinded
by it. In such a situation, I think cutting off one’s organ would be a
sacred duty if there is no other remedy. This will not happen to a man
who advances gradually. It may perhaps happen to one who has
suddenly lost all desire but whose past life was nonetoo good. To want
an instantaneously effective method of ensuring freedom from desire
and the urgency of the senses is much the same as asking for a son of
a barren woman. Such a result can be achieved only with the utmost
patience. A mango tree created by magic is only meant for the eye;
much the same is true of mental purity brought about with complete
suddenness. Yes, it may happen sometimes, that the mind is ready for
purification and is merely looking for association with holy men
which is a kind of a philosopher’s stone. On getting this it becomes
instantly aware of its purity and the absence of it earlier becomes a
dream. Surely, this [change] is no instantaneous occurrence, but the
simple and the shortest and, to that extent, the quickest
method is:
Withdrawal into solitude, seeking association with holy men,
singing the names of God and telling sacred stories, reading edifying
books, unremitting mortification of the body, a spare diet, living on
fruits, minimum of sleep, giving up of pleasures; anyone who can
practise these things will find control of the mind quite easy as the
amalak in the hand 1 . Practise these and meditate over the rest.
Whenever the mind is disturbed with desire, one should turn to
observances such as fasting.
. . .’s work was like Ravana’s activities. He practised penance
and acquired the nature of a demon. Rama did the same and acquired
the nature of a god. Thus, different fruits accrue from similar acts
according to the motives behind them.

Here is a list of persons going with us [to India]. I cannot say
whether all those mentioned will go or not. We have still to decide
about those whose names have a question mark against them. I have
written to Kuppu. You may ask him again to consult his father and
decide. Discuss things with Chhaganlal. Other names also may have to
be added. to the list. I take as certain all the names except those
against which I have made a question mark. I know this is all perhaps
like building on sand. Perhaps, the settlement may not come off; other
things also might happen. Nevertheless, we want to leave as soon as a
settlement is reached; it is therefore necessary to make all the
preparations. Banana flour is made here. There is ample facility for
getting it made and bananas are always available. I believe if we have
biscuits made of banana flour with us on our voyage, nothing else
would be required and we can carry on even if bananas are not
available. We should get carpets made out of gunny bags for all of us.
They will be useful in India also. Get these stitched and washed ready
for use. It is necessary to hem their borders also. Two carpets for each
would be preferable. They can be used one above and one below. It
would be still better if these could be given some sort of coating. Do
think about this. We should have something like the jug I have
brought for [carrying] water. If we can get the empty tins of olive oil
lying with us, repaired so that they can be corked, they would perhaps
be cheaper. Get them so repaired that they might be useful in India
also. Each one will have blankets, to be sure. They must have at least
two, at the most three. It is not desirable to carry much luggage with
us. I want every child to land in India with Indian-style clothes on.
The very young should have a lungi, a shirt and a cap like the round
one of velvet we have and the others should have a dhoti, a shirt and a
cap. The grown-ups like you should wear a safa and a long coat. But
you will decide this by yourselves. It is not quite necessary that you
should do exactly what I want. I see no need for the boys to have
shoes. However, if they have sandals they may keep them. I think new
ones should not be made. But I am not particular about this thing.
You may consider this also. It would be good if everyone learnt to eat
with one hand only (the right one) and that too sitting cross-legged on
the floor. It is desirable that they do not have to be taught to do this
after they are in India. They should not take the plate on their lap.
This applies to all who are to go. 1 therefore see no harm if all squat
on the ground to dine. If you do so you will have to clean the floor
with a wet cloth thrice a day. But that I think is desirable. Think of this
also. They should also know how to make obeisance to the elders.
What we want the youngsters to do, we elders should demonstrate by
doing ourselves. This may cause a little inconvenience in the
108

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

beginning, but it is worth while suffering it. They should learn to
distinguish between the pure and the impure. We should make all
necessary preparations irrespective of whether we go or not. We had
stopped for some days the use of toilet paper in the latrines by the
boys but we became slack again. I think we should stop its use again.
We should explain patiently to the older boys the whole significance
and object of making the changes. It would also be well if they knew
the geography of Bombay Presidency. The boys, I think, should start
wearing dhotis on the steamer. Consider what foodstuffs and how
much should be taken with us, and also how to carry them. Try to take
as few enamelled utensils as possible. Drinking glasses or cups and
such other things, made of brass, would serve our purpose. As we may
have to use lemon, we shall take with us the enamelled cups that are
already there. But we want to dispense with them as far as possible. In
the manufacture of these vessels many a man is ruined. In comparison
to the loss [of life] due to kicks and the lathis or sticks, the workers’
health has been affected to a greater extent [in this manufacture].
Consider this aspect and then decide.
I see good improvement today in Ba’s health. If she survives,
take it for certain that our [nature cure] remedies and faith in God
have saved her. She has come to realize that the doctor’s medicine was
the cause of her breakdown. She was tempted by a desire to take the
doctor’s treatment and I did not interfere. The punishment she
received was severe and so the lesson learnt was equally valuable. Ba
showed infinite capacity for patience. She did not trouble me at all.
The Gools showed great love. The doctor is a generous man. He does
not interfere much with what I do. We wanted very much to satisfy
him, but Ba later showed great firmness. I always read the Ramayana
to her and sing prayer songs. She appears to listen to these attentively.
I repeat Ramanama also. The intention behind all this is not that she
should survive; it is that, whether she lives or dies, her mind should be
pure and tender. I have made all preparations and inquired about
everything in case she dies. There is a cremation ground here
equipped with the necessary facilities. It is four miles away.

100. LETTER TO HERMANN KALLENBACH
7 BUITENSINGLE,
C APE TOWN ,

March 9 [1914]
MY DEAR LOWER HOUSE,

I have your two letters and wire.
If I were you I would not disturb the meals you have arranged.
Do not change what seems to agree so much only so that on occasions
you can do without them. Manilal won’t save all the time you
imagine. Your description shows that the preparation must take 1
hours. But that loss of time need not worry you. So long as there must
be cooking so long must there be loss both of time and life. But habits
of long standing cannot be altered in a day. You will observe that my
tolerance is again reasserting itself and I am becoming more and more
indifferent to the surroundings. Mrs. Gandhi’s sickness has given me
food for introspection and a review of the past. I am glad Manilal is
regaining his balance.
Mrs. Gandhi’s recovery (if the improvement continues) is
almost a miracle. And she has responded to our natural treatment. I
feel too that medical treatment would have killed her, not that she is
certain now to live. But hope has revived. I had prepared her for death
and had made arrangements for her funeral. There is a crematorium
here built owing to the energy of Lucheram1 . She has remained very
calm and sweet. I have now introduced in my life the counting of
beads. I sing hymns to her in the morning and read the Ramayana to
her in the evening and also sing hymns. Mrs. Gool sometimes comes
and listens. My food you should know ≈ tomatoes peeled by warming
them and banana flour and coconut biscuits, also ground monkeynuts or dried bananas stewed. The latter was tried for you. I had it for
the first time today. It takes no time and by itself makes a perfect dish.
There was very little water in it, of course, there was oil. Mrs. Gool
prepared it. Mrs. Gandhi or I had made it, it would have been better I
fancy. I add, of course, fresh fruit, principally grapes and a few
almonds which I have been taking for the past week to test their effect
on the eyes which have much troubled me. I take, I think, five
1

110

Chooharmal P. Lucheram
THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

tomatoes though I am not sure. The whole preparation does not take
Mrs. Gool longer than 30 minutes, if that. But on a good stove the
tomatoes to be soft should take no more than 5 minutes and the
banana when done not more than 15 minutes. This much cooking is a
concession to Mrs. Gandhi and a temporary indulgence for my palate.
Peeling of tomatoes is a necessity. But alone I should peel them
without warming.
Now for P. K. Naidoo, I was bound to give him the best advice.
And I offered Phoenix. It is today partly a passive resistance farm.
Whilst we may not disturb the even tenor of the Phoenix life, force of
circumstances must interrupt and then the settlers are involuntarily
tested. We may not expose ourselves to temptation. But when it comes,
we must face it. Or we have no character. I may not put my hand in a
lion’s jaw but may I fly away from it when it is in front of me? The
simile must not be carried too far because I see it is not a perfect
illustration. For if you may not fly away from the lion, you may not
from a seductive woman. As a matter of fact you must fly away from
both if you cannot face them without fear. You may not kill the lion
and you may not succumb to the woman. Reverting to Naidoo, when a
man asks me what he should do, must I not propose the best for him?
The secret of Phoenix is that it will and can harbour those who will
conform to its fundamental rules. And if Naidoo can stand them he
will be a help to himself and to Phoenix. Shelat 1 came, was found
wanting and went. Even Harilal Thakar went. And Anandlal and Virji.
There is a natural process of winnowing going on that very wonderful
place. I call it wonderful although it is partly my offspring. I have no
doubt it was conceived in the purest spirit, it was born amid most
strenuous and holy circumstances and it has been nurtured on a
spiritual diet which has been and is being continuously purified more
and more. It can become a place that would not hold an impure soul.
The future depends upon West and Chhaganlal mostly and partly on
Sam. Raojibhai and Maganbhai may be taken away from Phoenix at
an early date though not for a year or so perhaps.
Thambi has written to me. He is very bitter against us all. We
must meet his bitterness by the greatest gentleness. Simply walk over
to him. Tell him you do not want to hurt his feelings. And if he is
unwilling to talk, come away. Repeat the performance till your love
conquers his passion. This we must do so long as he is not found to

be, as he is not, a bad coin.
Your affairs I understand a little. I will say nothing. What I may
not like I shall tolerate and watch.
I have asked opinion today by wire to post you cheque for
£200. From this you should pay Eric in any event for the pressing
calls upon the family to the extent of £160. The Newcastle Hospital
bill should not be paid by you. But Miss Schlesin writes to me saying
she has transferred it to you for you to contest with the Government.
But if there is to be no contesting, please pay out the Passive
Resistance funds, not your own.
Be cautious about paying P.K. Naidoo or others. Refer them to
me when you are in doubt.
What a long letter this! I think I have covered all the points
raised by you.

101. LETTER TO HERMANN KALLENBACH
7 BUITENSINGLE,

Tuesday [March 10, 1914]
MY DEAR LOWER HOUSE,

The greatest grief imaginable has befallen me. My brother1 died
yesterday. I suppose simply thinking up to his last breath of me. What
a passionate wish it was on his part to meet me! 2 And for me I was
hurrying everything on so that I could go to India with the quickest
despatch and fall down at his feet and nurse him. But it was not to be.
Now I must go to a family of widows with my poor self as the head.
You who do not quite know the Indian patriarchal [system] cannot
quite realize what this may mean. Anyway my desire to go to India is
keener than ever. And yet who knows! I doubt very much whether I
shall ever realize that desire. However, I must prepare for the
pilgrimage and then calmly leave it in the hands of Him who wields

the almighty power.
These shocks make in me still more intense fearlessness of
death. Why should the event agitate one? The grief itself has a selfish
touch about it. It is no calamity that my brother is dead, if I am ready
to meet death and consider it as the supreme and welcome crisis in
life. It is because we fear death so much for ourselves that we shed
tears over the deaths of others. How can I who know the body to be
perishable and the soul to be imperishable mourn over the separation
of body from soul. But there is a condition attached to a real belief in
this beautiful and consoling doctrine. He who believes in it must not
pamper the body but must be its ruler. He must regulate its wants so as
to make it serve the dweller within and not allow the body to master
him. Not to grieve over the death of others is to accept a state almost
of perpetual grief for this connection between body and soul is itself
grievous.
These are the thoughts that rule me just now. I shall not write
another such letter just now. This has written itself. Please, therefore,
pass on to Polak. Let Manilal read it. And then you may pass on to
Chhaganlal for West and others to read.
I am revolving the idea in my own mind of help for the
indentured.

102. LETTER TO CHHAGANLAL GANDHI
C APE TOWN ,

Phagan Sud 14, 1970 [March 11, 1914]
CHI. CHHAGANLAL,

I have some time to myself just now. Medh writes to say that
they are plotting again in Johannesburg to take my life. That would
indeed be welcome and a fit end to my work. I would not be
frightened by this and stay away from Johannesburg on account of
this. In case I die suddenly, be the reason this or any other, I want to
set down here certain ideas which I have thought out and which I have
not so far placed before you.
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

113

“Service of the family should come first.” This is quite correct
from the point of view of our supreme interest. He alone who can
render such service will be able to serve the community or the
country. What that service consists in is the only point to consider. I
think selfless conduct will show that quite easily.
The life of service or political work which we have followed so
far seems to me of the lowest order. Ours is a notorious family, that is,
we are known to belong to a band of robbers. Without disparaging
our elders, we may say that they have possibly done service to the
people, but only incidentally, while they pursued their selfish interests.
Judged by common standards, it would seem that they have acted with
a fair measure of justice. That is, they treated people to a smaller
measure of oppression. At present, the family has fallen on evil days.
Any member who failed to obtain a paid job would be on the streets.
The highest our eyes can look up to is Narandas, slaving away in
Bombay. Other members of the family just loiter about or, wallowing
in the politics of [princely] States, manage to earn just enough for
their food from day to day. All of them are busy multiplying, arranging marriages, etc. The utmost limit of a grandmother’s or a daughter-in-law’s ambition is to get [the grandson or] the son married.
How may we save ourselves from this? If possible, we should
take another road. We should become farmers, in the first instance. If,
to our misfortune, that should bring unbearable hardships on us, we
should labour as weavers, etc., and live in the same state as we do in
Phoenix. We must reduce our wants to the minimum. As for diet, we
should, as far as possible, adhere to the system which we have thought
out. Milk, which is generally considered a pure substance, may be
taken, but it should be looked upon rather as the opposite of pure.
This is an important change. Its roots go deep; and its consequences
will be far-reaching. It is a separate question whether or not the
change will prove acceptable to all. But knowing at least that this
article is denied to millions, one should avoid it. The idea that it is
pure flesh and not in keeping with the way of non-violence will never
leave my mind. I do not think I shall ever be able to consume milk,
ghee, etc., while I inhabit this body. You should do with the minimum
use of fire. Any boys from the family who might wish to join should
be allowed to do so and admitted. They should not be permitted to
stay on if they failed to follow these ideas. Widows who might not
wish to live such a life should be respectfully told that you would pay
114

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

them each one and a half times as much as would be spent on each if
they were to follow that way of life and so clear your debt to them,
that, apart from this, you could give them nothing else. Never trouble
yourself to get anyone married and provided for. The boy, on
growing up, will arrange the business himself if he wants to marry. If
it does become necessary to find husbands for daughters, we would
offer them to those who are prepared to marry them with no more
than a tulsi leaf for dowry. We would not spend a single pie. We would
wait till we came across such a candidate and teach the daughter to be
patient. We should be prepared for some gossiping in consequence,
and to be sneered at. All this, we would bear with love. If we remain
upright in our conduct, we would come to no harm. To have offspring
is no religious obligation on us. It is none of our duty to multiply
numbers in the world. The real secret of life seems to consist in so
living in the world as it is, without being attached to it, that moksha
might become easy of attainment to us and to others. This will include
service of self, the family, the community, and the State. We should
not stop till we reach that stage.
Whoever joins us in this way of living will be to us as a member
of our family. We shall take in Raojibhai, Maganbhai, Pragji and any
others who may come forward. Should I meet with an untimely end, it
is my desire that you should order your life as indicated here. Be in
no hurry to leave Phoenix, but bear these objects in mind and stay on.
I am quite hopeful about Maganlal. If Jamnadas gets trained up, he
has the necessary spirit. He has determination, too.
After my death, the money needed on account of the widows
who have been my special responsibilities should be obtained from
Dr. Mehta. If it is not forthcoming, all of you who agree with the aims
set out above should make the necessary provision even if you have to
put yourselves to extreme difficulty and slave for the purpose. Harilal
will have to fend for himself. He may entrust the children to you. or
anyone else who is in India. Fuli has enough and to spare, so that
there is no question of providing for her. And now remain Gokibehn1 ,
Nandkorbhabhi 2 , Gangabhabhi3 and Gokuldas’s4 wife. If they live

together, that will be very good of them, graceful of them. If they do
not, separate provision should be made for each. Children may be
handed over [to them]. But it would be better if they come over to live
with the others. In that case, the total cost of maintaining them is not
likely to be [even] as much as Rs. 40. The expenses for Ba also should
be estimated on a similar scale. She should, at any rate, understand
that the right thing for her would be to live with them. And she, too,
should hand over the boys. The sons who are prepared to assumere
sponsibility for their mothers should, of course, be welcome to do so.
The suggestion made above concerns such of them as apply to us for
help. If Harilal takes upon himself the burden of maintaining Ba, let
him by all means. It would be better still if he maintained Nandkorbhabhi. Then the problem will remain only in regard to Gokibehn
and Goka’s wife, and Gangabhabhi. It would be as well if Kaku
should assume the responsibility for his mother, and Samaldas 1 on
account of his. The way suggested above is for those who would be
left with no support. No one will be justified in expecting, or will
expect, anything above your own standard of living. Since I consider
that to be the best way of living, the ideas outlined above do not
appear to be harsh. The logic behind this reasoning is based on
poverty which, indeed, appears to be the only sound basis.
After my death, you may show this letter to anyone you like.
For the time being, it may be read by Maganlal, Raojibhai, Maganbhai, Pragji and Jamnadas. I only want that these persons should not
mention it in other company. If you feel that all of them should not
be allowed to read it, show it to those only who, you think, should read
it.
I think the letter is so comprehensive that it will provide answers
to all the questions which may occur to you. If, however, any point
seems to have been left out, ask me. If you want to discuss any
questions with me, set them down in writing. If you differ from me,
have no hesitation in telling me so. You should also tell me if you feel
that the responsibility will be too heavy for you. Make all points by
way of criticism that may occur to you.

103. LETTER TO C. F. ANDREWS
C APE TOWN ,

March 13, 1914
MY DEAR CHARLIE,

I had your ocean post message as also cable from London.
There was also Reuter’s cable giving the gist of your interview with
Reuter’s agent. 1 I have expanded your ocean letter and sent it to
I[ndian] O[pinion].2 I took the liberty of omitting Mrs. Gandhi and
Manilal because they are your own. I omitted Kallenbach, Polak, and
West because their names did not seem to me to fit in with the
others. Perhaps you will make time to write to them individually if
you have not done so already. Regarding the omission of the last
three, I am not decided in my judgment. In such cases I obey the first
instinct.
I do hope you had a nice time with your people. For the last two
weeks I have felt like writing a letter to your dear father, but I did not
know whether it might not be considered presumptuous I could still
write, of course. I shall abide by your judgment and if I may write,
1

The interview took place on March 10, after Andrews arrived in London. He
was accorded a reception by Indians, led by Sarojini Naidu, the poetess. The report
stated that: “ . . . Mr. Andrews extolled the chivalrous patriotism of Mr. Gandhi,
during the railway strike, in calling off the passive resistance movement so as not to
embarrass the Government. He also extolled the heroism and endurance of the
Indians, and the generous and fairminded treatment of himself by the Union
Government.
“He said he was immensely impressed with General Botha’s sterling character
and simplicity, and added that General Botha had assured him that he would do
whatever he could to act justly by the Indians.”

The message, despatched on March 1, conveyed Andrews’ thanks to friends
in South Africa. It was published in Indian Opinion, 18-3-1914.

please let me have Mr. Andrews’ full name.
Mrs. Gandhi was near death’s door last week. I have therefore
done hardly anything else save nursing her during the last 10 days.
She rallied 2 days ago and the improvement continues. Owing to the
illness I have been obliged to remain at home.
I had a chat today with Sir Benjamin. He tells me the report has
been shown to him and that it is on the whole good. But as you know
we may not accept his verdict.
Copies of the reprint of your lecture1 have been sent to most of
the men with whom you came in contact. The Bishop has written a
charming letter in acknowledging his copy. Mrs. Drew is sailing for
London tomorrow. She has sent £5—for the P[assive] R[esistance]
fund. She sent me some names for sending the reprint to. The papers
have published notices as per enclosed cutting 2 . There is a request
daily from a few for copies. An attempt is being made to induce
Indians to take up copies for distribution among European friends of
theirs. W.P. Schreiner had a complimentary copy. He paid for 6 extra
copies for his friends in England. So you see your mission is showing
a double success. The great saint and the cause that brought you to S.
A. are being advertised to the good of humanity.
I suppose I ought to tell you that I had cable news of the death
of my eldest brother in Porbunder.3 He was like father to me He it was
who sent me to London. 4 He used to be very bitter against me for
being in S. A.,5 but his last letter was, to my great joy, one of complete
reconciliation. His one wish was to meet me. And I was longing to
hurry back to India. But it was not to be. I have now the responsibility
of having to look after 5 widows in my father’s family and of course
their children. However I am quite at peace with myself. There is a
very remarkable manifestation of sympathy for Mrs. Gandhi and
myself as the news of the loss is spreading among the community.6
I hope that you were able to recover your health in London and

104. LETTER TO MANILAL GANDHI
[CAPE TOWN ,]

Phagan Vad 2 [March 14, 1914]
CHI. MANILAL,

I have not delayed in the least in writing to you. It seems I write
wrong addresses. It happened in the case of Jamnadas. The same thing
happened in the case of Schlesin also. I shall hereafter read the
addresses again.
Ba is now getting better. You must have seen what I wrote about
Bapa in my letter to Kallenbach. Do write a letter to Chi. Samaldas.
You need not be disturbed by the intrigues that are being
hatched there. No man can hasten or delay my death even by a
minute. The best way of saving oneself from death is to go seeking it.
It is no doubt our duty to take care of our life in a general way. More
than this we need not do. We should rather welcome death whenever it
comes.
It will not matter if you do not try to save time by discontinuing
to cook for yourself. Let things go on as at present. I think it will take
three hours at least. You can save time only if you make more
changes in your diet. It is not necessary to make the changes for the
present. I have written to Kallenbach also accordingly.
Send the list of your books again to Phoenix.

MY DEAR LOWER HOUSE,

Yes, you may expend the amounts you suggest on the stones.
The inscription on both should be the same, only the names and the
dates will vary.
I know that I have your sympathy and more in the affliction that
has befallen me. But I must not say thanks to you. We are so

[PS.]
Bananas are and should be unripe. Remove the outer skin, cut
them into thin discs and dry in the sun 3 days. They are ready to be
stored away when they are quite dry and brittle. They can be ground
to any fineness or thickness and can be cooked as they are. With nuts
and oil and tomatoes they make a perfect meal. But, of course, this is
not ideal. The ideal is the uncooked meal. It is however the nearest
approach and the least expensive. For travelling where you may not
get fresh fruit it is perfect in the form of biscuits. These with dried
unripe mangoes could be carried for an army. And they would form a
most nourishing diet not at all sweet. Mrs. Gandhi is better but not
satisfactory. I fear that she has a fatal trouble in her stomach. The
only cure for her so far as I can see is a prolonged fast with the neem
leaves water. She may have cancer of the stomach. This never yields to
medical treatment but it must yield to fasting treatment if the patient
has stamina. Mrs. Gandhi has that yet, I think. This information is
however only for you. This is alarming and I am only conjecturing. I
have informed Chhaganlal. She moves about but in the heart of her
hearts she herself is not satisfied. The swelling recurs most obstinately.
I am slowly preparing her for the worst again. But the agony may be
prolonged. What a cruel man I must be or can be to thus contemplate
the death of others. However, such is my state just now. Nothing

106. LETTER TO JAMNADAS GANDHI
[CAPE TOWN ,]

Phagan Vad 6 [March 17, 1914]
CHI. JAMNADAS,

You are right in what you say about wheat and dates. Every
grain of wheat will yield a plant. That is not the case with a date palm.
The part of the date fruit 3 which we eat will not grow if planted. So
long, therefore, as we are still on the middle level, eating the date fruit
is not very objectionable. Groundnut is certainly open to objection, as
I have always been saying. We have not, however, reached a stage
when it can be given up. Olive is not open to objection because it
contains a separable seed. You have rightly pointed out the objection
against the sesame seed. Ultimately, we are to give up sesame oil itself
and make do with what oil can be obtained from dry fruit. Of course,
the objection I have mentioned will probably apply to every variety of
dry fruit; almond, for instance, is but seed. You will see on reflection,
however, that there is much difference between consuming wheat and
consuming almonds. An almond tree continues to flourish, but the
wheat plant, once the grain has been removed, is no better than a
weed. It is of no other use. No such violence as is involved in the
sowing of wheat and other operations is involved in similar operations
relative to almond. It is not possible, however, to go very deep into this
kind of argument. . I am but ignorant myself. I am telling you of my

own conclusions, tentative and immature as they are. The basic
principle, undoubtedly, is this: one should make do with the fewest
possible articles [of food] and in the smallest possible quantity, no
more than what is absolutely necessary to pay the body its hire. It will
be best to frame the rules of our diet bearing this principle in mind. A
man who cooks a meal of just an ounce of rough-ground wheat and is
free in five minutes is far superior to the one who wrings (as I do) the
utmost pleasure from a variety of fruits. Another, however, who lives
on no more than five bananas will out-distance the first. In other
words, one who lives on fruit diet stands a far better chance of rising
than the other. Even here, the mental attitude is the primary factor.
The motive is the chief thing.
We cannot deduce any rule that, if we can consume the fruit, we
can also consume the leaves, the bark, etc.
The reason why certain green vegetables are permitted on
ekadashi1 but wheat is forbidden seems to be an obvious one rather
than anything abstract. Since people do not have an entire meal of
vegetables or look upon them as food, some vegetables were permitted
for gratifying the palate; but wheat, being food was excluded and in
this way the original aim of eating less on ekadashi was to some extent
maintained.
Gourds, etc., are, like tomatoes, more or less a kind of fruit. The
tomatoes are allowed because they can be eaten uncooked. It is
doubtful if gourd and the like, if uncooked, can be digested by all.
Radish, etc., are but roots of a weed and the consumption of roots is
thoroughly objectionable according to Jain principles. When Ba
wanted to have ginger, I ate it with her to know its effects. I liked it
and continued to take it after neem juice. Ba has quite an enthusiasm
for it. Both she and I liked it. She collected some tender shoots of
ginger. They were nothing but roots. I ate them for a day or two and
relished them very much indeed. This morning, I was filled with
compassion and despised myself. It was as though I could see the
souls in these pieces of ginger. On one knot of it, there are several
tender shoots. To eat them amounted to destroying so many embryos.
Deeply pained, I gave up ginger today. I had not done so till now,
having kept myself free to eat it when necessary. Henceforth, I will
treat it as forbidden and avoid eating it as far as possible. Before I am

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

in India, I don’t want to place myself under any more restrictions than
those I have already accepted. Ginger, however, I will not eat in this
country.
Consumption of cooked food involves the destruction of life in
an unnatural, and therefore cruel, manner. The destruction of life
through eating uncooked food occurs in a natural manner. Moreover,
food, when cooked, loses its nourishing element (vitality).
Havingregard to this, we can practically eat only ripe fruit. To pluck
or eat fruit before it is ripe is objectionable. You will see from this that
I have not been able to act upon all the results of my thinking. To that
extent, my thinking is ahead of my action. But that will remain, of
course. The effort is always for eagerly following up thought with
action.
If the desire to eat our food while it is still hot comes back again
and again, it is because of the hold of a vicious habit of long standing.
The desire must be suppressed with the utmost effort. Improper
desires will always occur. By suppressing them every time, we grow
firmer in mind and gain in spiritual strength.
Ba’s condition is not so good, nor so bad. The oedema is quite
heavy today but she moves about with courage. I have asked her to eat
whatever she relishes. One cannot say what will happen. She is not
bed-ridden at present.
I am likely to be detained here for three weeks more.

to the Immigration Officers. It is suggested that these instructions
should be issued to the officers unless a new condition arises, namely,
that there is an inordinate influx of illiterate S. A.-born Indians into

There seems to be an obscurity in the Commission’s report on
this (the marriage) point.
(a) Plural wives of domiciled Indians should, with their minor children, be admitted irrespective of the fact whether they have previously
entered S. A. or not. Such cases are very few. And all these cases
might, within a specified period, be notified to the Union’s officials or

THE EDITOR

INDIAN OPINION
SIR

I have been so overwhelmed with wires from different parts of
the Union expressing sympathy with my wife and myself regarding
the death of my brother in India that it is impossible for me to thank
severally the Associations and individual senders. Numerous messages
have been received from Durban, Maritzburg, Johannesburg and other
places. I thank all most heartily for their sympathy. Whilst doing so I
would like to say just a word. To me as a passive resister and as a firm
believer in the oneness of the Soul, my brother’s loss should occasion
no greater pain than the death of Nagappen, Narayanasamy and
Hurbatsing, who were just as much my brothers as my blood brother
whose loss so many friends are mourning with me. Valliamah
Moonsamy’s untimely end is, if possible, a greater stab from the hand
of Death than my brother’s end. Yet I share the common human
failing, and the thoughts that arise in the mind from the loss of my
brother, who was in the place of father to me and to whom, next to my
124

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

dead mother, I owe all I am in life, are more vivid than those that arose
in me when those three brother passive resisters and the sister passive
resister died. The idea that is uppermost in my mind just now is that
death should cause no fear in us, if we have lived in the fear of God
and have done nothing in violation of the voice of our conscience.
Then, indeed, is death but a change for the better and, therefore, a
welcome change which need not evoke any sorrow. Such a change, I
feel, my brother’s death must mean for him. And we in South Africa,
especially those who are passive resisters, must learn not only not to
fear death but must be prepared to face it and welcome it when it
comes to us in the performance of our duty. So have died
Narayansamy and his three successors. I wish for no better end and I
am sure no other passive resister does.
Finally, may I ask those friends who have overwhelmed me with
their sympathy in my bereavement to help me, if the points of passive
resistance are satisfactorily settled in the near future, in my desire to
return to India to fall at the feet of my brother’s widow and to take
charge of the domestic cares of five widows in my father’s family, in
which the hand of death now leaves me the responsible head,
according to the Hindu usage.
I am. etc.,

CHI . MANILAL,

I hope it was after careful thought that you made the changes in
diet you have done. See that whatever you do is not [done in a hurry]
to be given up afterwards, and remembered merely as a dream. Some
of it at least must endure for the whole of your life. You have
introduced so big a change that you may perhaps find yourself in the
same state you were in at the end of chaturmas. There is only one way
to guard oneself against excessive eating, viz., to serve out the full

110. LETTER TO HERMANN KALLENBACH
7 BUITENSINGLE,

March 20 [1914] 1
MY DEAR LOWER HOUSE,

You seem just now to be the busiest man in our circle. Your
correspondence is invariably (almost) written in the train. Well, I hope,
the result of this activity will be greater peace for you and a great
benefit to the circle. I am not joking. I am serious though naturally I
am sceptical about the value of such restless activity. But under
exceptional circumstances it may be the lesser evil.
You asked me a question about the counting of beads. I forgot
to deal with it. There is undoubtedly great efficacy in knowingly and
deliberately uttering some sacred name as often as you can. The love
of the owner of the name then grows on you and you ultimately
merge in Him. Now every rosary has a stated number of beads. The
Hindu rosary has 108. You take the 108 names of the deity once
every turn of the rosary. And as the number of the beads is fixed you
never omit a name. Thus you simply contemplate the name without
worrying to know how often you have taken it or whether you have
omitted any. The Muslims have 99 beads to correspond to the 99
names of God. Some Hindus simply mutter the same name. In that
case the number of beads is of no consequence so long as it is the
same rosary. You are in a position to know then how often during the
day you have taken the sacred name. Thus to mutter the name of the
Highest without a selfish purpose is a most desirable practice. Hence
1

the universality of rosaries. I want to continue the counting if I can.
The more secretly it is done, the better of course. The early morning
and sunset are the best times and I try to keep these times at present. I
do not ≈ cannot for my eyes get up very early nowadays. I am going
to try again. I cannot just now have my eyes examined or take another
pair of spectacles. I want to observe the effect of the Indian climate on
the eyes.
Another question of yours was why was Indian Opinion
transferred to West and Maganlal? Simply because the Trust-deed1
contemplates it and the Trustees should not [be] made responsible for
what may appear in Indian Opinion.
Yours,

MY DEAR LOWER HOUSE,

Yes, I have given you a most thankless task to perform. I hope
that you will be able to make a healthy impression on Eric. My
analysis of Ritch was, I feel convinced, perfect. His children are
suffering for his sins. It was a most recklesslike [sic]. No more than
the present debts are to be discharged and then to the extent of not
more than £170 so far as I can see at present. Do not sour Eric by too
strong words. We can only put them in the best position possible and
then they must rise to it or fall.
As for Mrs. Polak, she must follow her own inclinations. She is a
different type. She knows or thinks she knows what she is doing. She
is a superior woman. And Polak is a gem of the “purest ray serene”.2
He can reflect those he loves. After all the money must go the way it
has come.

Phagan Vad 10 [March 21, 1914]
DEAR SHRI RAOJIBHAI,

I have your letter. I had heard about your fast. If you had a
reason for going on a fast, I have nothing to say. You will certainly
enjoy no solitude there. There should be more of physical activity in
Phoenix. That is conducive to peace. There the first place is assigned
to service.
The breakdown in J’s health has given me a fright. I wish she
recovers soon.
I feel anxious on account of Maganbhai. I cannot judge why
things do not get right [with him]. I also feel that it would be good if
he went along with me. Please keep on preparing his mind to that end.
We shall see what can be done in India. I have a persistent feeling that
the thing is due to mental illness. I am trying to discover why he
enjoyed good health in gaol, but this is all that I can think of. While in
gaol, the mind had been forced into an equable state and this had an
effect on the body, too, so much so that he kept well despite the sort
of food that he had to eat. Cannot he attain to that mental poise out of
gaol? Be that as it may, the only right course for Maganbhai seems to
be that he should go with me to India. Let him also think it over.

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

I shall cite in passing one instance, my own. Ba wanted to take
ginger. Since I was under no vow to avoid it, I started taking it along
with her in order to test its properties. Ba’s tongue loves dainties. She
happened to discover some shoots of ginger. I fell in love with them,
so much so that I also used to chew four or five of these tender shoots,
of the size of a grain of gram. One day, Ba collected a quantity of
these from Mrs. Gool’s basket and placed them in [our] room. I was
struck with horror to see them. The night passed. I sprang out of bed
in a fright, early in the morning. How could one eat ginger? This
thing, a single joint of which proliferated into so many shoots, must
indeed be full of lives. Moreover, to eat fresh shoots was as good as
killing delicate babies. I felt extremely disgusted with myself. I
resolved that I would never eat ginger, not in this life. But the real fun
comes now. Ba saw that I would not take ginger. She asked me the
reason. I told her. She also caught my point. She carried away the
very tendershoots and pressed me to take something from the rest. I
declined. The vow holds, but the tongue and the eye are like dogs.
The desire to eat ginger comes over me whenever the eye falls on a
piece of it. The tongue starts licking. But just as a dog greedily
watching food left over will not dare to eat it in the presence of the
master, the tongue is prevented from touching the ginger by the
watchfulness of Mr. Atman. My eye falls on it the whole day because
it is lying just where my papers are. It seems more difficult for me to
turn away my mind from ginger than it was to give up sugar or salt,
such is the state I find myself in.
What, then, should you blame yourself for? It is not for nothing
that the mind has been compared to a monkey that has got drunk.
What is the point in having high hopes of learning wisdom from me?
We are all sailing in the same battered ship and I, with greater wisdom
than the rest by way of experience, point out the direction in which
you are welcome to toddling along. We are all in darkness, groping
for the same thing. Maybe my steps are firmer and move with greater
confidence. To hold me in greater respect than this will amount to
arresting your upward progress. When I have conquered all desire, I
will instruct you without the least hesitation. For the present, let us pull
together in quest of Narayana1 who grants moksha and, undeterred
even if we lose our way or fall or get knocked about, go on seeking

113. LETTER TO JAMNADAS GANDHI
[CAPE TOWN ,]

Phagan Vad 11 [March 22, 1914]
CHI. JAMNADAS,

I got your two letters today. There is always twice the normal
quantity of post on Saturdays. Write to Rustomjee Sheth and Motilal1
about the neem tree. It will be good if Maganlal plants one whenever
he finds a sapling. From what Mr. Kallenbach has discovered,
macaroni can be eaten but only if obtained from a particular source.
There is a big risk, however, in that it is an article prepared by
non-vegetarians and one concerning which we have no information.
We can do nothing else but take their word. The traditional objection
of the Hindus against all ready-made articles of food deserves to be
respected, as far as possible. Jaggery is not merely [sugar-cane] juice;
kharo2 or salt is added to it. Moreover, sugar-cane juice is boiled and
from the whole only the sugar or jaggery is retained. If mangoes were
to be processed in the same manner, the product would likewise be
unacceptable. As for wind, it will probably be cured if [the sufferer] is
given neem leaves and pepper or ginger. Do you take plenty of
exercise? For the present you need not force yourself to get up early.
Did you read what I have written3 to Ramdas about fasting? If
not, ask for the letter and go through it. I don’t want to prevent boys
from fasting. Only, it should be done intelligently.
It is uncertain where else, apart from Johannesburg, I shall stop
on the way back. The shirts at the Farm are mine. I am afraid I cannot
spare any of them for you. You will have to have new ones made.
That is easily done. Take my shirt as a model.

[CAPE TOWN ,]

Phagan Vad 11 [March 22, 1914]
CHI. MANILAL,

I have been getting your letters. I see that your going over there
has been for the best. And it is as well that you are alone. You are too
quick in making changes. I wish some of them at least endure. It will
be enough if your habits become regular there. Personally, I think it
will be best if you come along with me. There will be no difficulty if
20 of us are together on the ship. I certainly don’t think Jekibehn will
be able to stay with me at any rate for some time after we reach India.
It is my desire to see you esteemed in India as a brahmachari of a
high order, your conduct so naturally well-disciplined that it cannot
but produce an impression on others. This will require hard work,
study and purity in you. No impression can be made by doing
anything with the deliberate object of producing one. If, however, the
things which commend themselves to one are best, they will impress.
You must, therefore, make your own choice and consider what you
want to do. You must then cling to the thing till death.
I am sending Chi. Harilal’s letter for you to read. Think over
the wretched state he has been reduced to. The fault is not his, but
mine. During his childhood, I followed a way of life none too strict in
its rule and he is still under its influence. Tear off the letter after
reading it.

[CAPE TOWN ,]

Sunday [March 22, 1914] 1
Everything is transient, except the atman. Not only should we
keep reminding ourselves of this but we should work on accordingly.
The more I reflect, the more insistently I feel the supreme importance
of truth and brahmacharya. The latter, together with all other rules of
morality, is comprehended in truth. I cannot help thinking, however,
that brahmacharya is important enough to share the place of honour
with truth. It is my unshakable faith that these two can conquer any
obstacle whatever. The real obstacles are the evil desires of the mind.
If, for our happiness, we depend in no way on our outward relations
with others, we would always think of what we ought to do rather than
of what people might say.

116. THE COMMISSION’S REPORT AND
RECOMMENDATIONS2
The report of the [Indian Inquiry] Commission was released last
week. We must admit that the report displays a sense of justice on the
part of the Commissioners. It is a unanimous report, signed by all the
three members. Messrs Esselen and Wylie deserve congratulations on
this. We had felt it our duty to protest against their appointment. But
they have not allowed their previously expressed views to affect their
judgment. The agitation by the community is responsible, we believe,
for this good result.
The Commissioners, as also Lord Hardinge, have criticized
the action of Mr. Gandhi, and the general body of the Indians who

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

acted on his advice, in abstaining from giving evidence. This criticism
is not al all surprising. They wanted that the largest possible number
of Indians should give evidence. We can understand why the Viceroy
also criticized this action. He had both toact consistently with the
advice which he had previously offered and to support the Commission. We believe, however, that the Indian community acted wisely in
abstaining from giving evidence. To speak plainly, an oath once taken
can never be broken. If they had tendered evidence, they would have
struck at the very root of satyagraha. Moreover, abstention from
tendering evidence has, in the event, proved to be an advantage. We
had three hundred witnesses at least. Indian Associations throughout
South Africa would have led evidence on our grievances. Then, there
were the Europeans ready to tender evidence. Thus, the mere
recording of our evidence would have taken six months. After that,
the Commission would have taken some more time before issuing the
report. It would then have been rendered impossible to introduce
remedial legislation in the current session of Parliament, as is now
likely to be done. What could have been more disastrous for us?
Again, if we had tendered evidence, the spirit of conciliation which we
find prevailing today would not have been there. It would also not
have been possible for Mr. Andrews to do what he did, sowing the
seeds of conciliation so silently and with such deep love and humility.
The reason is that our giving evidence would have aggravated
animosity. We, on our side, would have made bitter statements and the
whites would have retaliated. The latter would have led stronger
evidence against the evidence tendered by us, and in that case, would
not have had the sense of responsibility that they actually showed. In
these circumstances we could not have entertained strong hopes for
settlement as we do now. Thus, our remaining faithful to an oath taken
in the face of advice to the contrary by the Viceroy was sacred in itself
and it has yielded gratuitously other good sweet fruit. Such is the
magic power of truth and the efficacy of satyagraha. He who has
thefear of God in him need not be afraid of any man. 1 The truth of
this has been proved over and over again a million times.
A scrutiny of the Commission’s report leads us to the same
conclusion. Practically no evidence was tendered by us in regard to
the £3 tax and the question of Indian marriages. But these two issues
were in the forefront of our struggle, and the Commission’s recomm1

An Indian saying

VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

133

endations on them could not possibly have been better even if we had
tendered voluminous evidence. If we had led evidence in regard to the
£3 tax, very probably, as it seems to us, the Commission would not
have found it possible to criticize it as strongly as it did. All those
Indians who were misled into giving evidence rendered a disservice [to
the community]. One of them gave evidence about force having been
used and his testimony has been summarily dismissed by the
Commission. The evidence tendered in regard to the Immigration Act
was so flimsy that it undid the effect of the strong note submitted by
Mr. Polak to Sir Benjamin; leading such evidence before the Commission could only result in putting us off with mere trinkets. These
trivial issues, on which the community could have secured concessions
at any time after the settlement or as part of the settle-ment, provoked
the Commission’s strictures and proved our petty-mindedness. Let us
cite one or two examples. The Commission has recommended that the
certificates of identity be issued for three years’ duration instead of
one year. In fact, we are entitled to permanent certificates [of domicile]. And that was what we demanded before Sir Benjamin. In consequence of the demand for three-year identity certificates submitted to
the Commission, our demand for permanent certificates [of domicile]
has been set aside. Because of uninformed and scrappy evidence
tendered to the Commission on the question of trading licences, the
Commission simply dismissed the issue. The issue of the Gold Law
was also dismissed by the Commission as it was mixed up with other
issues. Thus, in regard to the questions on which evidence was tendered we shall have to be satisfied with much less. Let the community
note that all these matters were covered by the fifth point in Mr.
Cachalia’s letter1 . It contained a demand for reasonable administration
of all existing laws. But for this demand, the evidence that was given
could not have been given. If, therefore, our countrymen had not
been hasty and given the ill-considered evidence that they did, we
could have secured much more and the fifth demand would have met
with the same fortunate result as the demands in respect of the £3 tax
and other matters. No permanent harm has, therefore, been done by
their evidence, for the fifth point [in Mr. Cachalia’s letter] represents a
demand for a standing assurance. If the Government gives, as it will
have to give, such an assurance, the community will be justified in
taking up further questions like the administration of the Gold Law,
1

134

Vide “Letter to Secretary for Interior”, 12-9-1913.
THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

and the various trading licence Acts. Efforts are being made to see
that this becomes possible. The Commission’s report is not the last
word on the Indian question. In so far as it adversely affects our interests, it is not binding on satyagrahis, and the community is not likely
to be harmed by the misguided evidence given in ignorance by some
of its members. The remedy, of course, lies in the community’s hands
The Commission’s report establishes that our satyagraha was in
a just cause, that the charge of breach of promise levelled by us was
correct and that all our demands were reasonable. This result is by no
means insignificant. Unquestionably it is, as we believe, a perfect
success for satyagraha.
If the Government accepts the Commission’s recommendation
on the marriage question, the following will be the consequences:
(1) In the case of a person who has more than one living wife,
one of the wives and her minor children will have the right of entry.
(2) If a man with only one wife wants his marriage to be legally
recognized, he can do so, and get it registered before a Maulvi or
Brahmin or other marriage officer nominated for the purpose.
(3) A person with only one wife desiring to have his marriage
legally recognized can secure a certificate of legal recognition after
the registration of his marriage, and his wife will have the same rights
as a European wife.
(4) Arrangements are to be made for appointing Brahmins and
Mullahs as marriage officers for the purpose of new marriages.
(5) If a person has more than one wife, all his wives and minor
children will be permitted to enter; they will have no other legal rights.
(6) Even in the case of a lawful monogamous marriage, the
husband will be free to take a second wife as sanctioned by his religion. But the second wife will not be recognized for legal purposes.
(7) No Indian is bound to take any of these steps and non
will, in consequence of not doing so, forfeit the rights of his wife or
wives.
More than this we did not demand and, we believe, cannot. To
conclude: in addition to undertaking legislation about marriages and
the £3 tax, the Government will have to do all it can to meet our
demands in the Cape and the Free State and the demand relating tothe
administration of existing laws, and then alone will this epic struggle
of ours, which has been going on for the last eight years, come to an

who are we that we should claim to know the future?

that it was in the interests of the [Indian] community that Hindus and Muslims
live as brothers. It was perfectly possi-ble, he explained, for each community
to adhere to its religion and yet live in peace with the other.

April 1, 1914
DEAR MR. GOKHALE,

I had your two cables. To the last one I am just now replying.
I doubt whether Mrs. Gandhi will survive the settlement. I am
writing this by her bed side. I have to be her doctor, nurse and
everything. Then my brother’s death leaves the sole charge of five
widows and their children in my hands. Dr. Mehta is just now paying
the expenses of the others. To this he will, I do not doubt, add the
maintenance of my brother’s widow. But she and the others are most
naturally anxious to have me with them at the earliest possible
moment. I would, therefore, grudge having to go to London unless
you consider it absolutely necessary. If you do, I shall certainly come
if Mrs. Gandhi dies or is better—so well, that is to say, as to permit of
my being away from her, I suppose, at least for two months.
As I have already informed you, Indian legislation will not be
undertaken before the reopening of the Union Parliament on the
22nd instant.
I do hope that you will materially benefit by the cure at Vichy.

Chaitra Sud 8, 1970 [April 3, 1914]
CHI. MANILAL,

The changes you have introduced are excellent. If you keep
them up, you may do yourself much good. I have heard a great deal
about the moral effects of getting up early. Why should you be afraid
of April 1? Chaitra Sud 5 is looked upon as a sacred panchami1 ,
which means that you have introduced the change on an auspicious
day. In the last analysis, we alone can make fools of ourselves. If we
have spirit enough in us, no one dare make a fool of us.
The morning hours should be devoted to the most important
activities. It will do if you make it a rule to do a large number of sums
in arithmetic. I shall be able to tell you more later. I am sending some
books for you. Learn Sanskrit also very well.
Ba takes wheat coffee without milk. Except for that, she is on a
fast. She is confined to bed. It seems her oedema will go down. I
cannot say what the final outcome will be.

MY DEAR LOWER HOUSE,

Herewith Miss Hobhouse’s farewell for you to keep. You may
explain the meaning of it to Manilal. Her preface is wrong if it were
universally applied.
You have made a great change about getting up. You can keep
it up if you adhere to the retiring time which you should do.
Mrs. Gandhi is still practically fasting. She is taking wheat
coffee without milk or sugar in addition to the infusion of the leaves.
The swelling has not left her entirely but I think it is going. Anyway I
feel that no other treatment could be better.
The whole of my time is given up to her and she takes it all. She
resents my absence even for an hour. She is helpless without me.

Yours,

122. LETTER TO HERMANN KALLENBACH
[PHOENIX]

Tuesday [April 7, 1914]
MY DEAR LOWER HOUSE,

You will remember the following in the 2nd Chapter of the
Song Celestial: “Anger leads to madness which brings on loss of
memory. Then the intellect becomes weakened till at last the man
himself is undone.” Why did you give vent to anger? Manilal
describes the apple incident1 . Was that the cause? He says he retorted
and was sorry. Anyway your early rising must be for the sake of
control of passions.
It is obvious we both fasted practically the same day. For me it
was the nativity of Rama. And I had decided in Cape Town that as we

laid so much stress on Ramayana, I would fast that day and then I
further decided to fast every eleventh day of the two halves of the
month as I used to before 1 . There is no fixed limit for this, so that I
fasted on Saturday and then again on Monday. Hence I was up this
morning at 2 a.m. Manilal’s was the first letter I wrote and yours is the
second. You know how little sleep I need when I am fasting.
I have made a very drastic change here which I am asking
Jamnadas to describe in his letter to Manilal. He will do so and
Manilal must give it to you. Here I would only say that I took a vow
on Sunday that I would restrict myself to one helping only whilst at
Phoenix. I should endeavour to carry it out elsewhere also.
Mrs. Gandhi is lingering. She is taking a little food now but it is
next to nothing. At this rate she can’t live many months if that. Yet
who knows?
Please return the inscription I sent you. I shall have it rewritten
in bold letter.
I see here a bag containing your papers. It has some letters from
Mrs. Mayo 2 , etc. I thought I would search there for your Standerton
papers but my search was vain. I cannot get over the loss of those
papers.3 I cannot reconcile myself to the idea of their having been
deliberately stolen. If they are not mislaid, they must have been lost
by you owing to your usual habit of rushing. I do not ask questions
but I have a vague fear that even now you are rushing and spending
money in what to me would be idle speculation. But it is as well I am
not with you. Let your progress go along your own line. How long
could I reason? Only think, think and think forty times before you do
anything at all. Haste is waste. ‘Hasten slowly’ was Lord John
Russell’s motto.4
And you seem to me to have been hasty in judging Andrews. I
fancy that I know him better. Anyway, he does not consider every

123. A MARRIAGE PROCLAMATION
The Union Government Gazette of the 24th March contains a
marriage proclamation which is of some importance, as it bears on the
expected legislation on the Indian marriage difficulty. We give
elsewhere the proclamation in full. In effect, it requires banns to be
published of intended Mahomedan or Hebrew marriages, in terms of
the existing Natal legislation. If the proclamation has reference in
practice only to Hebrew marriages, we can have nothing to say. If it
anticipates the Indian marriages legislation and is intended to be a
feeler, it is an ill omen. For the essence of the Indian proposal is that
Indian marriages celebrated in accordance with the religious
ceremonial prescribed by any of the great Indian faiths should be
recognized by the law of South Africa so long as they are
monogamous in fact. Now Indian religions do not require publication
of banns. We have our own method (in our opinion, far superior to
that of the publication of banns) of widely advertising approaching
marriages. No Indian priest worthy of the name can possibly perform
a marriage ceremony if there is any objection offered against it in
terms of the religious custom or law. And it is the caste or the guild
which takes severe notice of any breach of the canonical law. Whilst
we do not wish to offend the sentiment of the Europeans of South
Africa regarding monogamy, we certainly do not contemplate
surrendering our religious principles by a hair’s breadth. We think it
but right to utter this note of warning whilst the proposed legislation is
still unpublished.

DEAR MR. GORGES,

I would like to bring the following point to your notice. Mr.
Polak sent the temporary certificates that were issued to the educated
Indians who were allowed to settle in the Transvaal in terms of the
Provisional Settlement of 1911 to be exchanged for permanent
certificates in virtue of the Immigrants Regulation Act of 1913, and I
understand that Mr. Chamney has written saying that such certificates
are not yet to be issued. May I know why permanent certificates are
not being issued?1

[PHOENIX,

April 8, 1914
DEAR MR. LANE,

I notice in the Union Government Gazette a Marriage Proclamation requiring those who want to have their marriages celebrated by
their Mahomedan or Hebrew Marriage Officers to have notices
published of their intention so to do. I do not know whether this
proclamation is deliberate as showing the future policy of the
Government in anticipation, or whether it is a proclamation required
for the Hebrews but necessitating reference to the Mahomedans in
terms of the Natal Marriage Law referred to therein. If it is the former,
I beg to draw General Smuts’ attention to the fact that what has been
1

A reply to this was received to the effect that the matter was under
consideration and it would be dealt with after the passage of the Asiatic legislation.

142

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

submitted by me on behalf of the Indian community is that past de
facto monogamous marriages celebrated according to Indian religious
customs should be legalised and that, in future, such marriages should
be recognized as legal. The Marriage Proclamation in question
introduces the practice of the publication of banns, a practice which is
totally opposed to both the Hindu and the Mahomedan usage; nor is
any such publication necessary, because of the respective religions
themselves requiring an elaborate process which renders fraudulent
marriages impossible. I feel that, whilst the legislation to give effect to
the recommendations of the Commission is being drafted, I should
bring this matter to the notice of General Smuts.
I observe, too, from Mr. Burton’s reply to Mr. Meyler that the
indentured Indians in the employ of the Railways Department have
deducted from their wages instalments in part payment of the £3 Tax.
I venture to suggest that a continuance of this practice is hardly
consistent with the attitude shown by the Commission regarding the
Tax. One of the chief points that the Commission had to advise upon
was the £3 tax, and it is submitted that this deduction might have been
stopped by the Government at least pending the report of the Commission, and now that the Commission has made such strong recommendations for the repeal of the Tax, I do trust that the officials
concerned will be advised, if they have not been already, not to insist
upon this deduction, for I assume that, if the Government bring in a
Bill for the repeal of the Tax, the arrears will be remitted.
I am,
Yours truly,

Friday [April 10, 1914]
MY DEAR LOWER HOUSE,

Just now I am nothing but an efficient nurse devoting my whole
energy to my task. Mrs. Gandhi is my sole consideration and she
claims me. If I am away from her for any length of time she cries
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

bitterly. I do not know what is to become. She may recover but there
is not much chance. She will linger on for a while but cannot survive
this illness. She has to be helped to do everything. I am only praying
that there may be no imperative public call on me whilst I am doing
this work.
You will now see why I cannot give you love letters at present. I
did not or did I tell you that I do not want to perform the opening
ceremony regarding the tombstone and I ought not to. We should get
our old friend Hosken or any other you may think of.
The drastic changes made here are most satisfying. If they
continue, they will form a splendid structure but we shall see. When I
have more time I shall go into them more fully.

127. LETTER TO HERMANN KALLENBACH
April 12, 1914
MY DEAR LOWER HOUSE,

Your letter of the 9th is petty, touchy and spiteful. It has made
me sad and shows that all your so-called reforms there are simply
superficial. What you call a circular letter is no circular letter. It was
addressed to you and Polak. In your letter of the 8th, you complain of
absence of my letter and in yours of the 9th you resent the very letter
which explains absence of anything from me. Polak went for me for
not writing and not getting Miss Schlesin to write about Mrs. Gandhi’s
health. You, Polak and Manilal are sufficiently interested in her health
to want to know about it daily; hence the letter from Miss Schlesin and
the instructions that she herself should write as often as possible.
There would have been no such letter had Mrs. Gandhi not been sick.
Now tell me wherein I was wrong in sending you what you call a
circular letter. Do you see my point and your pettiness? You are
entirely right when you say you are jealous (and wrongly so) of Miss
Schlesin and Andrews. Because she wrote the letter, it became an
offence to you. And as if your letter, warning me not to send you a
circular letter was not enough, you must perforce remark underneath
144

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

Miss Schlesin’s letter, “Please do not send me such circular letters
henceforth”. You should be ashamed of having done this.
Manilal writes saying that you were surprised that I should have
asked him to retire even [if] you might not have. Why surprised? You
and Manilal are not equals. Manilal is a lad having to form his
character. If he wants to cultivate the habit of early rising, it is essential
that he retires early. Your hours may not be regular. Manilal not
being a businessman need never have irregular hours. And I should
have thought that you would encourage the boy to keep strictly
regular hours even though you may not. I certainly do not expect the
boys to keep awake with me because I retire late. If Manilal has
misunder-stood the position, you may explain it to him. I feel the
same thing about his food. If he wishes to keep to a particular course
of diet, he should not change with you. If the entirely fruitarian
experiment had agreed with him, you should have allowed him to
keep to it and made the complicated changes only for yourself.
Mrs. Gandhi is much better but an event happened yesterday
which once more proved what I have told you, namely, that she has
both the devil and the divine in her in a most concentrated form. She
made yesterday a most venomous remark: “Who has opened
Devdas’s drawer?” suggesting that Jeki had tampered with it. She
spits fire on Jeki. I gently remarked that I had opened it. “Why?” was
the growling query. I said, “In order to see whether I could find a
sheet for you.” “That does not contain sheets,” was the retort, so
much as to convey to me that I had not opened the drawer but I was
telling a fib to shield Jeki. This was too much. And I again gently but
rebukingly remarked that she was sinful in her thought and that her
disease was largely due to her sins. Immediately she began to howl. I
had made her leave all the good food in order to kill her, I was tired
of her, I wished her to die, I was a hooded snake. The manner of the
delivery of these remarks was most vicious. I told her even though she
was ill, I could not pity her in her sins. The more I spoke the more
vicious she became. I kept completely self-possessed. I apologized to
her and told her that henceforth even to that extent I would not
remonstrate with her. Nor would I. She has a character and she has
none. She is the most venomous woman I have ever met. She never
forgets, never forgives. She is quite normal today. But yesterday’s was
one of the richest lessons of my life. All the charges she brought
against me she undoubtedly means. She has contrary emotions. I have
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

145

nursed her as a son would nurse his mother. But my love has not been
sufficiently intense and selfless to make her change her nature. What
wonder if Anglia and others cannot respond to my skin-deep love?
What wonder if they misunderstood me? Truly she has so far been my
best teacher. She teaches me emptiness of the world, she teaches me
patience, forgiveness, greater need for self-sacrifice, for love and
charity. The incident leaves me, I hope, a better, wiser, more loving
man if it also leaves me sadder. Yes, a man who wishes to work with
detachment must not marry. I cannot complain of her being a
particularly bad wife or bad woman. On the contrary no other woman
would probably have stood the changes in her husband’s life as she
has. On the whole she has not thwarted me and has been most
exemplary. But how can a leopard change his spots? And yesterday’s
incident would probably not have happened either in an ordinary
household. My point is that you cannot attach yourself to a particular
woman and yet live for humanity. The two do not harmonise. That is
the real cause of the devil waking in her now and again. Otherwise he
might have remained in her asleep and unnoticed.
I wish you would not just now repeat walks like the Pretoria walk
but allow Manilal to follow the even tenor of his life.
With love,
Yours,

128. LETTER TO MANILAL GANDHI
[PHOENIX ,
NATAL ,

Sunday, Chaitra Vad 2, April 12, 1914] 1
CHI. MANILAL,

. . . 2 Whatever Mr. Kallenbach’s hour for going to bed, you
must follow one rule alone. And the same about eating. Here is the
meaning of the sentences which you could not understand: “All acts
done in a purely legalistic spirit (in accordance with the literal
1
2

146

The date was supplied by Raojibhai Patel.
Some words appear to have been omitted here.
THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

meaning) are, indeed, cursed. Even so, it is stated that those who do
not keep doing the things as indicated by [the letter of] the law are all
cursed.” 1 The point is that mere bookish souls can never attain
moksha. The Gita has a verse to the same effect, which you may
ponder over. “The Vedas keep on the plane of the three gunas; be
thou, Arjuna, beyond those gunas.”—This is what Shri Krishna said to
Arjuna. This does not mean that one need not do the duties prescribed
in the Shastras. It means rather that doing them is not quite enough,
that one must understand their hidden significance, their aim, and go
beyond the actions themselves. The man who renounces the
prescribed duties and professes himself a barren Brahmavadin2 will
have no footing anywhere. He will have lost the support provided by
the Shastras while the foundation of inward illumination has not yet
been built, so that he is bound to fall. St. Paul therefore told the
Galatians: “Do perform the acts enjoined by the scriptures; but you
will remain under a curse, if you have no faith in the teachings of the
Lord Jesus and do not follow his teachings.” The same meaning is to
be read in “bond maid” and “free woman”. 3 Bond means bandhan.
Scriptures are compared to the mother in flesh who, it is pointed out,
has the status of a slave so that her children are also born slaves.
Faith, which means bhakti, is described as a divine mother,
whose children are angels. Read the sentences which precede and
follow in the light of this explanation and tell me whether you follow
them properly or not. The 56th verse of Chapter 15 in I Corinthians
means that sin is the sting of death, that, in other words, that a sinful
man alone feels death as a sting. For the virtuous, it is the means of
attaining moksha. The second line means that mere dry knowledge of
the scripture has the power of a curse. We observe this at every step.
Hundreds of sins are committed in the name of scripture. The
meaning of Romans V, 20 is simple enough. Scripture made its
appearance again and led to more crimes. As the load of sins
increased, however, God’s grace also increased in like measure. That
is, even in such evil times, men were found who broke themselves free
from the chains of dry learning and, teaching the way of bhakti,
brought out the hidden meaning of scripture; this was God’s grace.

Probably the reference is to Galatians, III, 10.

147

St. John, XV, 3 means this: “Now ye are clean through the word
which I have spoken unto you.” Here “are” denotes the future and
“through” should be taken to mean “by acting according to”.
Think twice before introducing changes by way of reform in
your life. But I wish that, having once adopted a change, you would
cling to it like a leech. Love the virtues of Mr. Kallenbach. Know his
weakness when you see it and keep yourself away from it. The latest
change you have introduced has not been adopted after due thought.
You are not bound to adopt all the changes which Mr. Kallenbach
may make. You must learn to think independently for yourself and
stick to your judgement. It will not matter if, in doing so, you
sometimes go wrong. You are even entitled to oppose my views
afteryou have honestly thought over a matter; in cases in which it
seems right to oppose me, opposition becomes your duty. It is my
earnest desire that you should understand the idea of moksha and
aspire for it. This will never come about, however, till you develop a
capacity for independent thinking and firmness of mind. At present,
you are in the condition of a creeper. It assumes the shape of the tree
over which it spreads. That is not what the atman does. The atman is
free and, in its essence, omnipotent.
“It is desire, anger, born of the quality of rajas, all-devouring
and sinful; know it to be the enemy.” 1 This is the reply that Shri
Krishna gave to Arjuna when the latter asked him what it was that
drove man to commit sin against his will. It means this: “The cause of
sin is desire, anger, which has its origin in the quality of rajas; is
all-devouring and drives men to sins without number. Know it, for
certain, to be the enemy.” This is an established truth. Hence you
should have remained quiet when Mr. K. lost his temper. When one’s
elders get angry, one should be gentle and not answer back; if forced
to reply, one should say: “I will correct myself; please forgive me this
time.” There is no admission in this of one’s having acted wrongly
on purpose. Later, when the person has calmed down, one may
politely put one’s doubt to him, if one has any. You can ask Mr. K.,
when he is himself, how it was wrong to serve apples picked from a lot
which was getting rotten.
David’s Psalm has a meaning which is worth understanding. He
desires in it the destruction of the wicked; the significance of this is
1

Vide Bhagavad Gita, III, 37. Here the original verse in Sanskrit has been

quoted.

148

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

that he cannot bear evil. The same idea appears in the Ramayana.
Gods and men both pray for the destruction of rakshasas 1 . The prayer
Jaya Rama Rama is inspired by the same sentiment. The spiritual
significance of the Psalm is that David (Arjuna—the godward
attributes2 ) desires the destruction of Duryodhana and others [the
satanic attributes]. This is the sattvic3 impulse. It comes into play when
one is in a state of bhakti. When one attains to the state of jnana 4 , both
the impulses subside and all that remains is pure consciousness—
Knowledge Absolute. You will not probably find this state described
in the Bible. Though David was imperfect, he was a bhakta 5 . His
sentiments have found expression in the Psalm in simple language
and, though a great man, he makes himself humble before God,
looking upon himself as a mere blade of grass.

I have told you will have to desert me and not I you. So that I should
like you finally to dismiss that fear from your mind. If I am called
upon to enter Gokhale’s mansion or Andrews’ without you, I will
refuse to enter. Only my own movements may become too hot for
you and you always wishing to go the whole length with me may not
be able [to] and may fall back. Our joint life does not demand
coincidence though that is what you are bringing about. If I can lie on

certainly not attempt to do any such thing myself and still not feel
ashamed to be your companion. I shall put up with you and love you

my side is concerned. Take care of your own and everything else will
follow.
I have not received the letters you say you are enclosing.
Death for Mrs. Mayo can only be welcomed by her friend.1 She
will go to a higher state and we must not form attachments for the
sake of the bodies of people. Through the body we learn to know
them but we do not need their bodies to continue to love them.
I shall have the inscription copied as you suggest.
I suppose I need not repeat here the information about the
changes here that I have given to Manilal.
Mrs. Gandhi is decidedly better. It remains to be seen whether
the change continues.
Some members of the Theosophical Convention visited Phoenix
on Tuesday. They were 9 in all. Miss Pillenbury was one of them. I
have asked her to describe to you the visit. They dined here. It was the
simplest style, no strange food was given them. Indian marrow, rice
and potatoes and rice pudding cereal, coffee and fresh lemon drink.
Old Nelson was one of the party. They seemed to be pleased. I had
sent the message that those who cared could come and visit the
Settlement.

131. LETTER TO MANILAL GANDHI
P HOENIX,
NATAL ,

Friday, Chaitra Vad 8 [April 17, 1914]
CHI. MANILAL,

Received your letters. Ba is, now at any rate, on the way to
recovery again.
Even there, I cannot but think, it will prove a rewarding practice
to sit down on the floor to eat. You should clean the place where you
sit down, so that no one could object. We have made it a practice to
sleep on the floor and so we may have our meal as well. It should be
enough if you mop the floor where the meal is to be served. One
would feel it awkward if one had to start doing this after going to
India. There is humility in sitting on the floor for a meal; it will mean,
moreover, that we are adopting a practice followed by crores of
people. It is few who have their meals at the table.
My diet consists of 18 dates, 9 bananas, three [sic] uncooked
groundnuts, four amatungulu and two lemons, with two spoonfuls of
oil added. I take a quantity of coconut kernel which I can chew.
Tomatoes being dear, they have been ordered only for such as cannot
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

151

do without them. Not everyone lives on one meal a day. Raojibhai and
I alone follow the practice. Ramdas carried on with it for a month. On
Mondays and Fridays, everyone goes without salt.
I do not know why people do not fast on the tenth instead of the
eleventh day [of each fortnight]; it seems obvious, however, that going
without the usual food at least one day in a fortnight purifies body
and mind. We want to have the palate under control but, falling short
of complete success, we atone for the failure once in a fortnight.
Moreover, we commit numerous sins mentally and hence by
balancing the account once a fortnight we realize our abject state. To
observe the ekadashi, it is not enough merely to keep a fast; the day
should be spent, rather, in reflecting over matters of faith.
I have already asked two books to be sent to you. The Gita
transcribed by you will be in addition to these.
“Such passeth from all ‘plaining’ to blest nirvana” is a
translation of sa shantimadhigachchhati1 . It means, he attains to
peace. He who has given up all desires, who is free from the sense of
“I” and “mine”, who is unconscious of his identity as a separate
being, attains peace. In the word “plaining” occurring in the English
[translation] above, ‘ex’ has been left out, so that the word is
“explaining”. Such a man escapes from all concerns (objects of
desire and pursuit) to the happy state of nirvana.
One who rises early should make no exception on Sundays. If
we do, we shall anxiously await the coming of a Sunday. If, therefore,
you seriously want to form the habit, you must get up at the same time
on Sundays as on other days.
Blessings from

doing now.1 I talk and I smile, I walk and eat and work, all
mechanically these days. I can do no writing whatever. The heart
seems to have gone dry. The agony I am going through is
unspeakable. I have often wanted to take out the knife from my
pocket and put it through the stomach. Sometimes I have felt like
striking my head against the wall opposite, and, at other times, I have
thought of running away from the world. But then again I reflected:
“The simple fellow that you are! Foolish one! Why do you go crazy
in this fashion? If you do not preserve your balance of mind at this
1

One of the inmates of Phoenix Settlement for whom Gandhiji bad great
regard was found to have been guilty of a moral lapse and had obviously deceived
Gandhiji. On being warned by him, the person promised not to sin again; but when
the offence was repeated, Gandhiji undertook a fast for 14 days.

hour, full of agony though it be, what use is the little wisdom you have
come by?” And so I pass my days at present. I want just now to
inform my well-wishers, “See here, my friends, J. has committed
terrible sins.”
When I knew all this, I thought I must atone for my own sin in
putting my faith in one who did not deserve it. I was about to
resolve on a fast for 15 days, but checked myself. I thought of Ba. If I
fasted for 15 days, that would mean Ba’s death. I gave up the idea for
the time being, deterred only by this fear. However, I decided
afterwards that J. must leave for. . . . 1 To go and live there was the
only right thing . . . 2 could do . . . 2 would come to no good by
remaining here. . . .2 I do not know what evil there is in me. I have a
strain of cruelty in me, as others say, such that people force themselves
to do things, even to attempt impossible things, in order to please me.
Lacking the necessary strength, they put on a false show and
deceive me. Even Gokhale used to tell me that I was so harsh that
people felt terrified of me and allowed themselves to be dragged
against their will out of sheer fear or in the attempt to please me, and
that those who found themselves too weak assumed an artificial posein
the end. I put [he said] far too heavy a burden on people. He, too, [he
added] strained himself to do things beyond his capacity when he was
asked by me.

135. LETTER TO HERMANN KALLENBACH
April 28, 1914
MY DEAR LOWER HOUSE,

You ask me whether it will be inconvenient for me to have you
here. What a question? You still observe the distance. What though it
were inconvenient? You have still a right to come. So come when you
like. Only I may have to leave for Cape Town any day now.
I have been unable to write to you for some days as I have not
been able to get up early for the last few days, the nights having been
disturbed by Mrs. Gandhi. She is getting better but sometimes
requires service during night. The discipline here is becoming more
and more severe. The boys may not now get up late on Sundays. It is
the same hour for all the days, i.e., 4 a.m. Only two meals are served
now. The times are 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. Two days in the week are
saltless. The little ones get two bananas and a naarangi each at 7.30.
The youngsters rise at 6 a.m. The school hours are 4.30 to 7 a.m., 7 to
9.30 physical labour, 9.30 to 10 bathing, 10 to 11.30 dinner, etc.,
11.30 to 2 school, 2 to 2.30 recreation, 2.30 to 3.30 Press work, 3.30
to 4.45 agriculture, 5 p.m. supper, 6.30 to 7.30 p.m. service. To bed
at 8 p.m. Coffee has now been rejected because I do not want any
makeshifts in India. Please let Manilal see this as I shall not be giving
him a separate account.
Your scale of diet is too extravagant and rich. Here we allow no
more than one ounce of oil per head. You take nearly 6 oz. per head.
The other allowances are also on the same liberal scale and it therefore
makes the body gross. The scales should be fixed with some
consideration for the lives of the poorest of mankind. In any case the
scale cannot be followed in Phoenix without causing very great
disturbance. We are now using gingili 1 oil as I have been able to
procure the finest quality. I commenced the experiment first. The
taste has agreed with all. Whether it will agree with all constitutions

Gandhiji has spelt the word as “gingelly”.

here remains to be seen.
As for Polak, could he not buy the property and pay rent and
interest at the same time? I say this without much consideration. The
whole to be paid over in, say, 5 years’ time.
I am writing this under too much disturbance. The inscription is
being sent by Jamnadas. I must not perform the opening ceremony.

136. “HIND SWARAJ”1
I wrote Hind Swaraj in 1909 on board the ship during the
return voyage from England. Copies of the book having been
confiscated in the Bombay Presidency, I published a translation in
1910. It is now five years since the ideas in it were expressed in
public. And during this period, many persons have had discussions
with me on those ideas. Englishmen and Indians, both have written to
me about them, several expressing dissent. At the end of it all,
however, I find that the convictions I stated in the book have grown
stronger. If only I had the time, I could set forth the same ideas more
elaborately, with additional arguments and illustrations. I see no
reason at all for revising them.
Numerous requests having been received for a second edition of
Hind Swaraj, the inmates of Phoenix and the pupils there have found
time to print it as a labour of love.
I should like to comment on one thing only. I have gathered an
impression that, though Hind Swaraj does not advocate the use of
physical force at any time and in any circumstances, and advocates
always the use of soul-force to gain the desired end, the result of its
teaching has been to create hatred for the British and to suggest that
they should be expelled through armed fighting or use of violence
otherwise. I was unhappy to know this. Such was by no means my
object in writing Hind Swaraj, and I can only say that those who have

Swaraj”, 22-11-1909.

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

drawn from it the foregoing conclusion have totally failed to
understand the book. I, for one, bear no ill-will against the British or
against any people or individuals. All living creatures are of the same
substance as all drops of water in the ocean are the same in substance.
I believe that all of us, individual souls, living in this ocean of spirit,
are the same with one another with the closest bond among ourselves.
A drop that separates soon dries up and any soul that believes itself
separate from others is likewise destroyed. For myself, I am an
uncompromising enemy of the present-day civilization of Europe. I
tried to elaborate my view in Hind Swaraj and show that it is not the
British that are responsible for the misfortunes of India but we who
have succumbed to modern civilization. India can be free this very
moment if we turn our back on this modern civilization and go back
to our ancient way of life, which embodied the right ethical principles.
The key to an understanding of Hind Swaraj lies in the idea that
worldly pursuits should give way to ethical living. This way of life has
no room for violence in any form against any human being, black or
white.

Monday [May 4, 1914]
MY DEAR LOWER HOUSE,

You must excuse my not writing to you regularly. I have not a
minute to spare and I have no heart to write just now except when I
am obliged. I am unable to get up early and unless I can do so I
cannot write. The new discipline taxes me to the utmost.
Your telegrams I have misunderstood. I still do not know their
meaning. I do not know whether you have to give me some news of
further distress or what. However, your letter will say something.
I have, I think, answered all the points you summarised in your
last letter. The Nagappan inscription, Manilal can write from

139. LETTER TO HERMANN KALLENBACH
May 6, 1914
MY DEAR LOWER HOUSE,

Jeki has been found lying more than once. I therefore told her
that she could not stay away from her husband unless she was
absolutely superior to him. Indeed she is inferior to her husband. The
latter is no hypocrite. But Jeki is a finished hypocrite. You may
understand what all these discoveries must have cost me. However she
has now consented to go to Fiji. I have Dr. Mehta’s authority by
cable. So she goes next Sunday escorted by Miss West. She leaves by
a Castle boat for Cape Town, and will there book for Fiji.
You did not ask for English inscription. You had it there. You
asked only for Gujarati. And that you have. If there was anybody’s
fault it was mine for the delay. But perhaps you will understand why I
was delayed. Nagappan’s I have written to you about already.

cable is for my comfort and convenience. But Mrs. Gandhi is now
much better. If her progress continues, in a month’s time she should
regain most of her former health. In that case and in any case I could
come to London taking her with me. And after consultation with you,
we may both proceed to India directly and the rest of the party may
leave here after we have left. This will enable me to reach India
without any great loss of time. At the outside it can be only three
weeks. Please therefore cable if I may still come. In view of your own
and Dr. Mehta’s letter I should much like to come. It would be a
disappointment to me, if you do not let me come. Unless, therefore,
you are leaving for India to reach there before me, I do hope that
your cable will authorise my coming to you.
The draft bill1 is not yet out. It may, therefore, take quite to the
end of June before I am free to move. And it is just likely that a final
settlement may not be reached at all. In that event the struggle must
recommence and I dare not go to India. I am fully prepared for either
event.
I am,

MY DEAR LOWER HOUSE,

Pardon me for not writing to you promptly or fully. I have not
written fully because your letters have not been with me at the time of
writing. I have not written promptly because I get no time. Jeki and
Mrs. Gandhi have put such a severe strain on me that I feel like doing
nothing at all. I have never been so sorely tried as I am just now. I
cannot write everything because I have not the energy but when we
meet you shall have it all.
I am keeping your letter before me today, so here are the
answers.

The reference is to the Indians’ Relief Bill.
THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

1. I say that the walks to Pretoria should be stopped. If you want
to cultivate regular habits, disturbances should not occur.
2. Yes, there is a letter from the Poet and it is a nice letter. I shall
have it sent. It is not by me just now.
3. If I must go to London you may not come because you will
be taking the party to India. I should go to India from London.
4. Isaac I fancy is going to Johannesburg. He will not be
allowed to come to India. He is just now at Phoenix.
5. Dahya has offered to come to Phoenix and I have said he may. I do
not know that he will come to India. Jeki will probably not go to Cape
Town as I can get a boat to Australia on the 31st May. But I am not
sure. I see there is a boat to Australia on the 20th from Cape Town. I
am inquiring.
I have answered about Valliamma and the Valliamma Hall. As to
Polak’s property, I must consider. The matter may not be done in a
hurry. More later.

MY DEAR LOWER HOUSE,

You must have little love for me if it is dependent upon letters
from me and if it misinterprets absence of letters and does not believe
that there must be sound reasons for the extraordinary absence. I have
told you that latterly I have gone through mental shocks and agonies I
have never gone through before. I do not want to write anything. I do
not want to talk to anybody. I want to live in solitude and yet I am
talking, writing and living in company. In the day-time I can do little
writing. I am unable to get up early in the morning. Can you not enter
into my feelings and let your love overlook the omissions and the
faults?
Here is Valliamma’s inscription in English. This I think finishes
the list, does it?

Love is mute, it does not complain. Love is blind, it sees no

Love is constant, never varying whether in adversity or prosperity.
Love is never hurt. Love never tires. How has yours fared of late!
Manilal knows nothing of Manilal of Fiji. He is an infatuated
lad. Now that I know Jeki, I know that she is not a patch upon Manilal
of Fiji. The latter is an honest man. He has left what an injured
husband would feel. Is it any wonder? He has bluntly given vent to his
feelings. Is it not honest? I could only keep Jeki away from her

husband. Now I find that she is inferior. She is a liar, a wretched
hypocrite, without pity, without remorse, full of evil passions. Could I
ever keep her from her husband? Why, she would soon be as bad as
he is and take part in all his enjoyments. Why should she not?

I have not the energy to write to you myself, but it is better that I
dictate something rather than I should let you remain without any
letter at all. Manilal will give you a translation of my views on regular
walks to Pretoria. This fast2 has been a very rich but very bitter and
painful experience. I have suffered tortures and I am still suffering. It
has left me utterly exhausted. However, more I must say later. If you
have to go to India in charge of the party, of course I shall meet you
at Bombay because I shall precede you and you will certainly be
better able to cope with the party on boat than I can. When I go to
Cape Town, you will certainly accompany me. I may be in Johannesburg during the week in order to be able to attend to many matters.

May 18, 1914
MY DEAR LOWER HOUSE,

This fast has brought me as near death’s door as possible. I can
still hardly crawl, can eat very little, restless nights, mouth bad. But it
would be all right. The fast was a necessity. I was so grossly deceived.
I owed it to Manilal of Fiji, to Dr. Mehta, and to myself. It was one of
the severest lessons of my life. The discipline was very great.
Everyone around me was most charming. Mrs. Gandhi was divine.
Immediately she realized that there was no turning me back, she set
about making my path smooth. She forgot her own sorrows and
became my ministering angel. And she still remains the same. The
result is that she is better in health. I appealed to all not to go in for
fasting but to rejoice that one of themselves was trying to purify
himself. All caught the fire and I was helped all along.
I felt it my duty not to let you or Polak know because that
would have thrown additional care on me and no good purpose could
be served by informing you. The step had to be taken by me
prayerfully and I took it. I would not miss the experience. What the
effect will be I do not know.
Please let Polak read this so that I may not have to write the
same thing twice. I am still too weak to write much.

fast of 14 days the severest trial of my life1 . The fast was broken on
Saturday last and I am feeling much better today. Mrs. Gandhi too
has responded to the careful nursing and today for the first time after
my return to Phoenix I am at the Press working at the desk having just
left Mrs. Gandhi to her household work.
Now I know you will excuse me why I should not have written a line
to you after that very serious last conversation we had. Do please let

I had a very sweet letter from Miss Hobhouse this week. I am
not replying just yet but may do so next week.
Mrs. Gandhi often recalls your love to her and thinks of the

upon Mrs. Mayo with regard and veneration. Hers was [a] truly noble
soul. It was a most strenuous life that she led up to the very end. She
was one of the few true interpreters of Tolstoy’s teachings, and she
will be best known to the world as such. To the Indians of South

152. LETTER TO “THE TRANSVAAL LEADER”1
[JOHANNESBURG ,]

May 23, 1914
[SIR,]

In your today’s issue of the Leader, you publish certain remarks
made by Mr. Justice Mason, to which you give the headings
“Credibility of Evidence”, “Judge’s Remarks on Indians”.
I have no desire in any way to controvert His Lordship’s
statement which may be justified by the facts brought to his notice
from time to time, but it should be well understood by the public that
Mr. Justice Mason confined his remarks to a certain class of Indians
only, whom my Association has no desire to direct from such
criticism. He did not, as Mr. Greenberg appeared to suppose condemn
Indian evidence on national or racial grounds at all. There are also
certain classes of non-Indians equally guilty of attempts to mislead the
Court, but I do not presume that, in similar circumstances, you would
speak of the Judge’s remarks on Europeans. It is notorious that
lawyers, like doctors, see mainly the seamy side of life, and they will
necessarily draw conclusions from what they see. In spite, however, of
1

This was signed by A. M. Cachalia and was in reply to the following report
in The Transvaal Leader: “Some rather strong observations regarding the credibility
of Indian witnesses were made by Judge and counsel in the Witwatersrand Local
Division yesterday. The case was one in which an Indian applied for the sequestration
of a compatriot’s estate and the latter resisted an order on the ground that the
applicant was not a creditor to the amount of £50 as provided by the Insolvency Law.
“Mr. Justice Mason remarked that the evidence in support of the respondent’s
case was what one very often found in Indian cases. There generally seemed a number
of witnesses for one side fortuitously at hand when the opposite side gave away its
whole case. . . .
“ . . . In giving Judgment, Mr. Justice Mason said that the respondent’s case
was that, in order to defeat other creditors, the applicant agreed with him to take over
certain goods in reduction of his debt, and that that was done. In support of that, the
respondent produced witnesses who conveniently happened to be present when the
agreement was made, although the parties making it must have known that the
arrangement was one which would be somewhat open to criticism in the eyes of the
law. Then there were two more witnesses who happened to come on the scene when
the arrangements were being carried out, and who seemed to know all about the
collusive agreement. Now, these were coincidences which, if true, were of a
remarkable character. Unfortunately, however, these coincidences so often appeared
in Indian cases. They had got to face that fact.”
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

167

what might have been to a less just man a strong temptation to
exaggerate, Mr. Justice Mason confined his remarks to that section of
the community which he believed to be guilty and did not level an
indictment against the whole of the Indian community, as one might
suppose from the first few lines of your report.
I trust that you will find space for this letter in order to remove
any wrong impression that might have been created.

May 23, 1914]
I shall not be pleased just because you recite verses from the
Gita. I don’t care whether or not you read history, do sums in
arithmetic or learn Sanskrit. What is necessary is that you should
acquire self-control. That is what I want. I may agree to be some
one’s slave, but not that of my mind. There is no sin as base asbeing
the slave to one’s mind. Be wise, therefore, and learn to discipline
your mind. So you will be able to live with me. Otherwise I have no
need of anyone. Nor am I conceited enough to want to teach you or
anyone else. I have a pupil, to train whom is the most difficult task. It
is only by training that pupil that I can do some good to you, to India
or the world. That pupil is myself, what I call my mind. Only those
who thus become their own pupils are fit to stay here. Others who
cannot stand such a life had better not stay here. Such a person would
do well to leave this place. It is a sin, however, to do anything blindly
(without a purpose, mechanically). I want no such thing.

154. INTERVIEW WITH E. M. GORGES1
P RETORIA ,

May 27, 1911
Upon Clause l Mr. Gandhi indicated that he valued this provision mainly
for the sake of appearances. He thought that the appointment of a large
number of Indian priests as marriage officers might easily lead to abuses, as
some persons representing themselves as priests might not be of the highest
character. He contemplated therefore that a somewhat sparing use would be
made of the power of appointment, and that only such priests would be
selected as were known to be of unimpeachable reputation. He thought that,
for practical purposes, the machinery of registration under Clause 2 would and
should become the usual method of legalizing Indian marriages, and he
therefore deprecated very strongly the limitation of the right to such marriages
only as existed at the commencement of the Act.2
. . . Another point which was considered at the interview between Mr.
Gorges and Mr. Gandhi was the expediency of enabling Magistrates generally,
whether appointed as marriage officers or not, to register Indian marriages
under Clause 2. 3
On Clause 3 Mr. Gandhi does not appear to have taken any exception to
1

On May 30, 1914, the Governor-General, Lord Gladstone, addressed a
despatch to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, forwarding printed copies of the
draft Indians’ Relief Bill, and pointing out certain verbal amendments made therein.
In the course of the despatch, the Governor-General reported: “Mr. Gandhi has been
summoned from Natal, and a copy of the Bill as printed was handed to him by the
Secretary for the Interior on Wednesday morning. After perusing it he saw Mr. Gorges
again on Wednesday afternoon. I understand that he seemed on the whole to be
satisfied, and that the substance of the interview may be summarised as follows.” No
other report of the interview is available.
2
The despatch continued: “I may mention that I had previously caused to be
conveyed to Mr. Gorges an expression of regret at the introduction of the words ‘at
the commencement of this Act’. Mr. Gorges said that they had been inserted by
General Smuts’ direction, but he did not know whether the Minister’s decision on this
point must be regarded as irrevocable. I am therefore not without hope that Mr
Gandhi’s representations in regard to this clause will not prove wholly ineffective.
He will have an opportunity of discussing the matter with General Smuts in the course
of the next few days.”
3
The despatch here added: “Mr. Gorges, I understand, will suggest to General
Smuts the insertion of a provision that, for the purposes of this action, the term
‘Marriage Officer’ shall include any Magistrate.”
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

169

proviso (b) of sub-clause (2). He urged, however, that the children of deceased
women, who would have been eligible for admission under this clause, should
not be excluded from its benefits. Mr. Gorges told my Secretary that he would
submit to the Minister an amendment to the following effect: after the word
“defined” at the end of the clause insert some such phrase as “or the child of the
exempted person and a deceased woman who, had she lived, could have been
recognized as a wife within the meaning of this section, or whose marriage
could have been registered under the provisions of section 2 of this Act”.
These, so far as I am aware, were the only points raised by Mr. Gandhi upon
the Bill. 1
He, however, made the following representations upon questions of
adminis-tration. He asked for facilities for the admission and registration of
all existing plural wives, whether in or out of South Africa, of Indians lawfully
resident in the Union. This, you will observe, is a slight extension of the
second recommendation on page 39 of the Commission’s Report, where the
grant of the privilege is contemplated only in the case of plural wives who had
actually lived in the country. Mr. Gorges did not seem to regard the request as
un-reasonable, but he told my Secretary that he was not aware of the view
which General Smuts might take of the proposal. Mr. Gandhi renewed his
request for an assurance that, so long as the immigration of Natal-born Indians
into the Cape did not exceed its present dimensions, such Indians should be
admitted without the imposition of a test, and particularly without the
application of the provisions of Section 4(1)(a) of last year’s immigrants
Regulation Act. He did not ask for legislation, as presumably he is well aware
of the very serious difficulty which the Government would experience if the
question of the Cape entry were again to be raised in Parliament even by the
introduction of the small amendment recom-mended by the Commission on
page 16 of their Report. I gather that the Commission attached no great
importance to this recommendation andthat after the position had been
explained to them and they had been apprised of the reason why the words “at
the commencement of this Act” had been inserted in Section 4(2)(a) of Act 22
of 1913, they intimated that the recommendation was not one which they
would be disposed to press.
Mr. Gandhi renewed his plea for a satisfactory statement in respect of
the declaration required under the Free State law from Indians entering that

In his interview to Gandhiji on May 30, only a reference to which is
available in the Governor-General’s despatch of June 5, 1914, Smuts agreed to the
three legislative points raised by Gandhiji, Vide “Extract from Governor-General’s
Despatch”, 5-6-1914.

Province. This point should occasion no difficulty as General Smuts and Mr.
Gandhi had previously come to an agreement upon it.
Mr. Gandhi then raised two new points.
(1) He asked for some declaration or assurance that vested rights under the
Transvaal Gold Law should be recognized and preserved. Mr. Gorges told him
that this was really a matter for the Mines Department, and suggested that he
should discuss it with General Smuts.
(2) Mr. Gandhi urged that a free pardon should be granted to all bona fide
passive resisters in respect of convictions for bona fide passive resistance
offences, excluding all offences of violence which had been committed during
the passive resistance campaign. I see no reason why the Minister should
adopt a non possumus attitude towards this request, but I am not aware of his
views.
As regards Clause 4 of the Bill, I understand that the Government think
it undesirable to interfere with the special legislation governing the status of
indentured Indians under the Natal Acts, except in so far as the repeal of the £3
tax is concerned. For this reason they are disinclined to modify any
provisions mentioned in Clause 4. Mr. Gandhi, I believe, made no comment
upon the clause.

Thursday [May 28, 1914] 1
CHI. MANILAL,

I have your letter. While you express your regret, you say in the
selfsame letter that on that very day you had forgotten to serve so
important an item as the vegetable. You say it was left out, without
explaining how it happened. Who is to blame? Why did you entrust
the task to anyone else? You should have yourself carried the vegetable you had lovingly cooked. You may as well take a lesson from
this. There is no need to be sorry for what is past and over, but it is
important that one should learn something from it. While there, learn

to be devoted to your duty and cultivate self-discipline. This cannot
be achieved, however, unless one thinks.
Have regard for everyone there, think of the good qualities in
others, rather than their weaknesses, and be mindful of your own
shortcomings. Instead of gossiping away your time, keep thinking. A
single moment wasted is so much [time] lost from one’s life and so
much stolen from God. Understand this and use every moment well.
See that your body becomes tough.
The Bill has been published and is likely to come up next week.1
One does not know, though. There has been no meeting yet with
General Smuts.

156. THE RELIEF BILL
The long-expected Indian Bill has now been published. We
reproduce the full text with the schedule. 2 It is a simple and short
measure and seems to carry out the recommendations of the Indian
Commission in so far as legislative action is necessary. The Bill
removes the marriage difficulty and restores the status as it existed
before the Searle judgment. It repeals the £3 tax and remits the unpaid
arrears. Lastly, it validates Natal certificates of domicile, if the owner
can establish his identity with the certificate by proving that the
thumb-impression on it is his own. There is another clause in the Bill
with which the community is not concerned. It is the clause which
enables the Government to give a free passage to any Indian not
otherwise provided for if he renounces for himself and his family all
claim to domicile in Natal or any other Province of the Union.
There are certain alterations necessary in the Bill. It will be a
proper thing to use for validating future unions the machinery
provided in the Bill for validating existing unions. Amendment will
also be necessary for protecting the children of deceased wives, where
such wives, if alive, could have been recognized under the present Bill.

It was introduced in the House of Assembly on June 2
Vide “The Indians Relief Act”, 1914.
THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

Assuming that the Bill with the suggested alterations becomes
law, there will still remain the other matters recommended by the
Commission and the matters covered by Mr. Cachalia’s and Mr.
Gandhi’s letters. These require administrative treatment and include
the Free State question, the Cape entry and the administration of
existing laws. If satisfactory assurances are issued in connection with
them, the struggle that has gone on for years, and that has meant
enormous losses and sufferings to the community, may be said to
have fitly and honourably closed.

DEAR MR. GOKHALE,

I was thankful to receive your cable. Mrs. Gandhi is much better
but still weak. If she comes I shall bring her with me & Mr. Kallenbach may also come so that he may say good-bye to his people and
also be with me. If you will not allow me to be with you as your nurse,
I would like to go away to India immediately after our consultation.
As I do not know the state of your health I do not want to write
a long letter though I feel tempted. I have, however, written1 to Sorabji
& asked him to see you about what I have written to him if you are
well. He will then take instructions from you.
The Indian Bill has passed through the first stage. It is quite
satisfactory & I am about to have another interview with General
Smuts about the other points. There is, therefore, every prospect of the
struggle being finally closed. In that event I should leave for London
about the middle of July & even earlier if I can.
May I ask you please to cable the state of your health when you
receive this?
Mr. Kallenbach who is just now with me wishes to be remembered to you.
I am,
Yours sincerely,

158. FRAGMENT OF LETTER
C APE TOWN ,

Tuesday, Jyestha Vad 2 [June 9, 1914]
We cannot pass any judgment on Mr. Sinha on the basis of what
we read in newspapers at this distance. Mr. Norton also acted formerly
as a public prosecutor in such cases. Who is a leader and who is not is
a matter of opinion. Generally, a satyagrahi will express no opinion.
In the kind of situation you mention, if one were to offer satyagraha
and be imprisoned in consequence, the purpose of satyagraha would
have been served. We need not always speak out in such cases. There
is no ready answer to the question when satyagraha should be offered.
A satyagrahi does not deliberate in advance when embarking on
satyagraha. When he finds anything done that violates his conscience,
he should use soul-force against it. Even at the time that I first started
satyagraha, I considered it to be but a part of dharma. I have discovered from experience that it is the only religion and the only chintamani1 , and it has, therefore, developed in me especially in its aspect
as dharma. He is a satyagrahi who has resolved to practise nothing but
truth and such a one will know the right way every time. One’s entire
life should be permeated with truth. This will come about gradually
through the observance of yamas 2 , niyamas3 , etc. Just as, in learning
secular subjects, one has to work at them for many years, so too must
one make efforts to understand the nature of satyagraha. As the veils
which cover your atman and mine fall off, the atman of each will
shine the more brightly and be the more resolute satyagrahis in battle.

159. INDIAN GRIEVANCES
The Bill as originally circulated, but not gazetted, has already
been amended in the sense indicated as being necessary in our leading
article 1 last week. It will be remembered that the original draft
required Indians applying for the validation of a marriage by virtue of
its provisions to satisfy the Marriage Officer “that there existed at the
commencement of this Act between them a union then recognized as
a marriage under the tenets of an Indian religion which they profess”.
The Bill as amended, and now gazetted, reads that the officer must be
satisfied “that there exists between them a union then recognized as a
marriage under the tenets of an Indian religion which they profess”.
This amendment provides, therefore, for the validation of future
marriages celebrated within the Union or elsewhere. Then, again, paragraph 3, sub-section 2, of the Bill is amended to provide that “the
child under the age of sixteen” shall include “the child of the exempted person and a deceased woman who, if she had been alive, could
have been recognized-as the wife (as herein defined) or whose union
with the exempted person could have been registered as a marriage
under section 2 of this Act”. The amendment speaks for itself, and
the Bill now seems to satisfy the legislative requirements of Passive
Resisters. We hope that it will have a speedy passage through
Parliament.

Wednesday, Jeth Vad 3 [June 10, 1914]
DEAR BROTHER,

When Ramachandra was about to go to the forest, King
Dasharatha asked him to ignore his [Dasharatha’s] promise to Kaikeyi
and not to go, breach of promise though this might mean. Ramachandra disre-garded this desire born of the common worldly attachment for the son and went to dwell in the forest, thus showing true
reverence for his father, and so made Dasharatha’s and his own name

immortal. Harishchandra, by selling his wifeand showing himself
ready even to bring down the sword on Rohit’s neck, proved his
devotion to his wife and his love for the son. Prahlad, by disobeying
his father’s order, rendered a service to him and brought about his
deliverance. Mirabai1 , by leaving Kumbha Rana, turned the Rana
himself into her disciple. Dayanand2 ran away from his parents,
breaking betrothal already solemnized, and even gave the slip to the
men who had been sent after him; in this way he showed his devotion
to his mother and father. Lord Buddha went away as his young wife
lay asleep.
We find many similar examples. Pondering over them, we must,
in the difficult situation in which we are placed, do what seems the
right thing from the point of view of true ethics. In the case of
Shravana, the finer, intangible form of service happened to flow in the
same channel as outward, physical service. Not infrequently,
therefore,we fail to discover from his example what the right course
should be. He who habitually follows the path of truth will know the
right way at the crucial moment. If the things such as poems about
disinterested-ness, which we read are of no help to us when faced with
moral dilemmas, we will have read them in vain, parrot-like. We could
not have reflected over them. If, despite our having read the Gita, it
does not come to our help at the last moment, we might as well have
not read it. This is the reason why I have always said: “Read little, but
reflect over the little that you read, understand its significance and be
ready to put it into practice.”
It is only when we cease to be selfishly attached to those we love
that the heart feels true compassion and renders service to them. To
the extent that I have grown free of such attachment for Ba, I am able
to serve her better. The Buddha, by leaving his parents, brought
deliverance to them as well. Gopichand, by his renunciation, displayed
the purest love for his mother. In the same way, you will be serving
your parents by strengthening your character and cultivating spotless
morality. When your soul has grown pure, it cannot but produce a
corresponding effect on all those whom you love.

163. LETTER TO RAOJIBHAI PATEL
C APE TOWN ,

Saturday [June 13, 1914]
DEAR SHRI RAOJIBHAI,

I got your letter so late today that I am in no position to write to
you by today’s post or even send a telegram. I shall now send a
telegram only on Monday.
Where it is a question of a mother’s love or a son’s affection, it
is something of a moral dilemma for a third party to offer advice. But
1

The Natal Mercury in an article had doubted whether Indians would be
allowed to remain in the Province. It had contended that, when the £3 tax is removed,
the privilege of remaining in the country will be taken away from Indians and the
only alternative left for them will be either to re-indenture or return to India. It had
also pointed out that under the Immigrants Regulation Act the minister had power to
declare all Asiatics “prohibited immigrants” on economic grounds and thus to deport
ex-indentured Indians.
2
On June 22, Gorges replied: “General Smuts desires me to say that it is
perfectly clear from the report of the Commission that it was never intended that, by
the repeal of the provisions of the existing laws dealing with the £3 licence, the
position of the ex-indentured immigrant would be prejudicially affected in some other
way; and had there been the slightest doubt on the subject, he is sure that the
Commission—consisting as it did of three eminent lawyers—would certainly have
drawn attention to it. The Minister himself is quite satisfied that the effect of the Bill
as it now stands would not be to bring into evidence the position which the Mercury
and African Chronicle would have us believe will be created.”

178

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

offer it I must. When you took the decision you did on the strength of
your father’s letter, we were able to judge your mother’s feelings. Her
letter does not introduce any new factor. It has given rise, however, to
a new concern, and love has naturally gained the first place in your
heart. If now you can take a decision, with a mind free from selfish
attachment, your love can be transformed into a pure and divine
thing. You can give it to the entire world, that is, strive to do so. That is
the end to which one must love and serve one’s mother. Any other
form of love is of an earthly character, such as is common in the
world, a love purely of the physical frame. You recite poems, often
enough, which sing of freedom from such love. Recite this one, Know
this world as of little good, and reflect over its inner meaning. What is
the significance of The Living One’s kinship only with that which
breathes? What is distinctive of the Phoenix way of life is that we
strive to cultivate in us what we read about. Your going to India will
have but momentary effect; ultimately, there needs must be grieving
and weeping, be it after five days or fifteen, and certain separation
ever afterwards.
Moreover, we aspire after a way of life in which we would not
have a single pie of our own. Consider what men of such poverty
would do in a situation like this.
That you should always yearn for a sight of your parents is
good indeed. It is your duty [however] to repress the longing for the
present and free your life more and more from the sway of
attachments. You are enduring exile only for the sole purpose of
training your character. This is the condition of vanavasa1 for you.
Through it alone will you bring credit to your parents. The way of
self-indulgence is not for you; if, instead, you raise your atman higher
day by day and acquire a greater measure of self-control, you will be
free, for the present, from the obligation of returning to India.
In reasoning thus, I have not had the slightest regard to the
circumstances in the press. In giving the advice I have done, I have
only considered what would best conduce to your spiritual progress.
All the same, if you do feel yourself drawn to India by human
attachment to your mother and cannot be at peace with yourself while
remaining here, by all means go. Treat what I have said only as advice

AND JAMNADAS GANDHI
C APE TOWN ,

Saturday [On or after June 13, 1914] 1
I should welcome your keeping pace with me, but I don’t
expect it. I have never wished that you should all follow me in
everything I do. But whatever you undertake to do, you must carry
out. . . .2 There is no question of coercion, of course. Having, however,
given up the evil of . . .3 , if you cheat me, you are certainly to blame
. . . . 4 it may be conceded that the boys have reached a certain level.
They refrain from certain things in Phoenix; while there, they regard
them as things to be avoided. How, then, can they go after the very
same things when away from Phoenix? No one is obliged to do
without salt. Everyone refrains on principle from strong spices,
addictions of any kind, sweets, rich feasts, tea, coffee, etc. And
likewise, sexual indulgence, stealing, untruthfulness and late rising are
shunned by all. How can anyone who finds this too strict a rule stay
there? Every institution has certain rules which must be observed both
in and outside the place. If anyone does not do so, there is no point in
his remaining in the institution.
What you mean is that the boys and others do some of the
things because of their regard for me and not voluntarily, and that,
therefore, they are cheating me. The blame for this may be mine, but I
have only one way of escaping it and that is by not staying with
anyone. This does not seem to be my duty at present. If R . . . is

driven by his regard for me to make a show of adopting a saltless diet,
when I have asked him to do no such thing, and so deceives me, how
am I to blame? . . . 1 I don’t love you any the less for your not
adopting a saltless diet and J . . . any the more for his living
exclusively on fruits. There is no special sin or virtue in eating or not
eating salt. It is the underlying principle which raises moral issues.
Imam Saheb is not the less dear to me because he will never adopt a
saltless diet. Miss Schlesin takes an opposite course to mine in all
matters, but in some ways I place her character very much higher than
that of you all. In all the changes [we introduce], our aim is to practise
and develop self-discipline to the best of our ability. What I said that
evening was that anyone who is not ready for this may leave me. I
think I was perfectly right . . . .2 I am not much in love with Norton’s
action nor do I despise Bengali lawyers. A satyagrahi has no concern
with them and his field of duty is quite different from theirs. The
point of your question is, [how one may know] whether a person is a
true satyagrahi or not. If you cannot know this yet, I will only say that
it is a matter of intuition, that others cannot explain it. We are making
all these efforts to master the palate, etc., in order to be able to
understand this. . . .3 Do not think that self-discipline means living on
a saltless diet. You may live on a dry crust of bread, two days old, and
a pinch of salt. That may, of course, be a much higher thing than my
enjoying all manner of fruits and nuts. The moral worth of our
actions is to be judged from the motive behind your eating dry bread
and my living on fruits.
Purity of character is not put to shame, but rather gains further
strength, by what others say against us.
If you have done anything unworthy, confess everything to me.
Unless you do so, your fasts and the many other penances you may
go through will be in vain. I am getting impatient to be there but
cannot run away from my duty.
I am not likely to go back on a pledge once taken, even if the
sun were to rise in the west.
If those whom I believed to be very pure are really so sinful, I
don’t wish to nourish this body and keep it alive even for a moment.
It is not easy for a man to stick to his pledges.

166. A HISTORIC DEBATE
The second reading of the Indian Bill was carried by a very
substantial majority and became the occasion for a weighty
pronouncement on the Government’s Indian policy.2 General
Smuts’speech was studiously moderate and not at all offensive as
some of his speeches on the subject have been in the past. General
Botha’s speech was worthy of the occasion. We feel grateful for his
declaration that the Government proposed to stand or fall by the Bill.
The other speeches delivered in favour of the Bill were of the same
high order and, if the spirit of justice and conciliation that pervaded
the speeches is continued in the administration of the existing laws,
there need be no fear whatsoever of any Indian trouble arising in the
future. We take the speeches as an earnest of the intention of the
Government and the legislature that the resident population is to be

treated with justice and fair play. Contrary to past experience, General
Smuts made it clear that, this time, not only had the Government
considered the feelings of the Imperial Government and the
Government of India, but they had considered the Indian sentiment
also. We trust that the same policy will be followed in the future.
What could have contributed to this high tone of the debate?
Certainly the watchfulness of the Imperial Government; certainly,
also, the courageous handling of the question by the Viceroy. Mr.
Andrews’ mission of love, too, contributed not a little to the lofty tone
of the debate. His spirit seemed to watch and guide the deliberations
of the House. And none of these helps would have been at our
disposal if we had not helped ourselves. The spirit of Passive Resistance it was which made this trinity of causes possible. Let the community, therefore, understand that its last weapon at a critical moment
is Passive Resistance, which has been once more fully vindicated. But
we hope and we have reason to believe that the community will not be
called upon again to pass through the terrible fire of suffering which
it has had to pass through during the last, long years.

C APE TOWN ,

June 20, 1914
DEAR MR. MARSHALL CAMPBELL,

With reference to this morning’s conversation between us about
the telegram that appears in today’s issue of the Cape Times regarding
the Indians’ Relief Bill, I beg to repeat what I said to you this
morning, viz., that I do not know of any such Indian agitation as is
referred to in the wire. I am sure that no responsible Indian has taken
exception to the Bill. I do not believe for one moment that the Bill
makes the Indians, affected by it, prohibited immigrants—a result

168. LETTER TO INDENTURED INDIANS
[CAPE TOWN ,

After June 22, 1914]
TO

INDIANS C OMING WITHIN THE S COPE OF ACT 17

OF 1895

MY DEAR BRETHREN,

You must have known by now that the £3 tax which you, your
wives and grown-up children had to pay every year has been repealed
and that the collection of arrears has been suspended. This means that
you can live in freedom in this Province without re-indenturing
yourselves. The Act of 1891 which applied to those who arrived
before 1895 will now apply to you as well. It was in order to bring this
about that you, I and hundreds of our brethren put up a struggle and
went through suffering. But The Natal Mercury has stated that your
position has become worse than it was and that now you will be either
compelled to re-indenture yourselves or sent back to India. This is not
true. The Government has stated categorically in one of its communications that the inference which the Mercury has drawn is not
correct.1 The Imperial Government and the Government of India are
parties to the settlement. I know how they understand it. They have no
doubt that the repeal of the tax means that you can live as free men
and that, if you live so in Natal for three years, you will get the same

rights of residence as Indians who arrive as free immigrants. And
finally I want to tell you that, if, under the new Act, you are treated as
prohibited immigrants, as The Natal Mercury says you will be, no
matter in what part of the world I may be, I shall use all my strength to
get-so terrible an injustice removed. I am convinced, however, that the
Government intends nothing of the kind and also that the Act bears
no such meaning. This is the view of Mr. Marshall Campbell, too, who
worked so hard to secure the repeal of the tax. You need have,
therefore, no apprehensions on this score and I hope that no Indian
will henceforth re-indenture himself out of fear of being expelled
from this Colony.

169. THE LATE SIR DAVID HUNTER
The news reached Durban on Sunday that Sir David Hunter,
K.C.M.G., one of Natal’s most sincere and broad-minded public men,
had passed away, after an operation at a nursing home in Edinburgh.
Sir David was well-known as one who stood up for the weak and
oppressed. In as out of Parliament his voice could always be heard in
favour of justice and fair-play, especially on behalf of those who were
unrepresented in the Legislature. The Indian community will feel his
loss very keenly. During his twenty-six years’ connection with the
Natal Government Railways as General Manager he was known as a
humane employer. He always spoke well of his Indian employees and
they always thought highly of their Chief. We well remember, at the
time of Mr. Gokhale’s visit, Sir David speaking at the historic banquet
in the Durban Drill Hall, in the capacity of Chairman, saying that,
through long and varied experience, he had learned to respect his
Indian staff for their faithful and useful service, and he, therefore had
satisfaction in believing that they reciprocated his feelings towards
them by loyal trust in him. He also spoke of the innate dignity and
courtesy which were characteristic of the Indian race. Sir David, along
with many others, maintained that the £3 tax was an unjust imposition,
and we had the assurance from his own lips that he intended to
support its repeal at the earliest opportunity. Had it not been for the
unfortunate illness which took him to Scotland in the hope of relief,
we are confident that there would not have been a more faithful

the relatives and friends we offer our sincere sympathy and
condolence, and we feel sure that the whole Indian community will
share our feelings.

I trust that your letter will be liberally couched. I have already
told you something about the opposition I shall have to face.
I have been thinking over the Gold Law discussion. Protection
of the vested rights (in the sense in which I have used the term) of
those trading and residing in Gold areas is of vital importance and I
hope that General Smuts will apply to the consideration of this matter
the same generous spirit that he has, I am grateful to be able to say,
applied to that of the other matters we discussed. I trust that on this
point also I shall get a definite reply at an early date so as to enable
me to make final arrangements for my departure.
You will kindly send me the letters about Messrs Bhyad and
Camay too on Monday.
May I thank you for the great patience and courtesy shown to
me by you throughout our somewhat protracted discussions?
I am,

172. SPEECH AT CONGRATULATORY MEETING1
C APE TOWN ,

June 27, 1914
Mr. Gandhi, in replying, referred to the period 21 years ago when he
first came to this country, an Agnostic. He had since learned, however, to
recognize that there was a Divine purpose in the world, and a Divine hand
guiding events conformably thereto. In the long struggle for the removal of
Indian disabilities, a struggle which had absorbed the best part of his life, he
had had many a hard knock, and many things had been attributed to him that he
1

Gandhiji spoke at a gathering of European and Indian friends who had
assembled in the evening to congratulate him on the passage of the Indians’ Relief
Bill. Senator Marshall Campbell and Hugh M. Meyler, M. L. A., expressed pleasure at
the removal of £3 tax and other outstanding disabilities of the Indians in South
Africa. The report in the indirect form is from a despatch by the Parliamentary
Representative of The Natal Mercury.
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

187

had neither done nor intended to do. The method on which he had relied, which
he thought was now beginning to be better understood had nothing in it of a
lawless or desperate spirit, but he knew always that it made more demands on a
man’s courage and endurance than methods of violence could do.
Mr. Gandhi said it was a harder form of agitation, which, in the present
case, could not have succeeded had his own countrymen not supported him, as
was their duty. He felt himself to have been but a tool, and one of many tools.
His deep thanks were due to the many European friends whose help had most
materially contributed to the success now realised. He remembered how, during
the month of the trying march into the Transvaal, a large number of Europeans
had met the Indian column at various points along the road and encouraged
them with sympathy and practical assistance. Potent, however, though
passive resistance was as an instrument for winning reforms—perhaps the
mightiest instrument on earth—it could not have achieved success had the
Indian community not moderated their demands to what was reasonable and
practical. This, again, was not possible until some of them were able to see
the question of Indian rights from the European standpoint.
Mr. Gandhi went on to say he had made it his aim to see that question with the
eyes of those who had seemed to his fellow-countrymen to be doing them an
injustice; and he thought that, after long effort, he had fairly well succeeded.
As to the Bill, he would say that it was a settlement of present difficulties. He
felt that his countrymen in South Africa, after their struggle of eight years,
were entitled to a reasonable period of peace. He had been impressed by the
spirit of national and Imperial responsibility manifested in the recent
speeches on the Bill in the Union Parliament, and, if that spirit continued, he
had no doubt the Government here would be able to solve the problems which
still remained in regard to their Indian subjects. He did not see that the peace
now accomplished needed ever to be disturbed. There would be no more influx
of Indians into the country. Indentured labour had been stopped for ever—let
them thank heaven for that. The Indians knew perfectly well which was the
dominant and governing race. They aspired to no social equality with
Europeans. They felt that the path of their development was separate. They did
not even aspire to the franchise, or, if the aspiration existed, it was with no
idea of its having present effect. Ultimately—in the future—he believed his
people would get the franchise if they deserved to get it, but the matter did not
belong to practical politics. All he would ask for the Indian community was
that, on the basis of the rights now conceded to them, they should be suffered

188

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

to live with dignity and honour on the soil of South Africa.1

We do not aspire to social equality, and I dare say our social
evolution lies along different lines. We have stated so repeatedly —
that we shall not at present ask for the whole franchise. We understand
who is the predominant race here. In the process of time, when we
have deserved it, we shall get the franchise also. I dare say, but that is
not a question of practical politics. There will be no further influx of
Indians from India—thank Heaven! —so that it is only a question of
the fair and just treatment of the Indian population that is here, and, if
that population is to live in peace, the least it is entitled to is to have
the ability and opportunity of living here in absolute peace, and with
honour and dignity. If that is not what we are entitled to, I do not
know what we are entitled to.2

What follows is from a “special” despatch dated June 29 and published in the
issue of June 30. It was preceded by the following resume of a part of Gandhiji’s
speech: “It had been his privilege to make life-long companions and friends, almost
brothers, in South Africa amongst the Europeans. Where should he go to find such
faithful, such noble friends, if he might say so, as Senator Marshall Campbell.
Senator Marshall Campbell had shared their miseries and shared their sorrows; even
in the thick of the struggle he had come in order to learn, and in order to gain, and he
had no doubt that anybody who did join such a struggle did learn and did gain. It had
never been a struggle of violence. They had not used passive resistance as a weapon
of the weak. to be properly wielded, it required an infinitely stronger weapon than
violence. If the spirit which had guided the deliberations of both Houses in the
passage of that Bill, and of all their individual friends, was the spirit which would be
applied to several other problems, there need be no fear of a recrudescence of passive
resistance. After a struggle lasting eight years, the Indians needed a period of peace,
and it was for the Europeans not to be sparing of sympathies.”

174. LETTER TO E. M. GORGES
C APE TOWN ,

June 30, 1914
DEAR MR. GORGES,

I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter 1 of even
dateherewith setting forth the substance of the interview that General
Smuts was pleased, notwithstanding many other pressing calls upon
his time, to grant me on Saturday last. I feel deeply grateful for the
patience and courtesy which the Minister showed during the
discussion of the several points submitted by me.
The passing of the Indians’ Relief Bill and this correspondence
finally closes the passive resistance struggle which commenced in the
September of 1906 and which to the Indian community cost much
physical suffering and pecuniary loss and to the Government much
anxious thought and consideration.
As the Minister is aware, some of my countrymen have wished
me to go further. They are dissatisfied that the trade licences laws of
the different provinces, the Transvaal Gold Law, the Transvaal
Townships Act2 , the Transvaal Law 3 of 1885 have not been altered, so
as to give them full rights of residence, trade and ownership of land.
Some of them are dissatisfied that full inter-provincial migration is not
permitted, and some are dissatisfied that, on the marriage question, the
Relief Bill goes no further than it does. They have asked me that all
the above matters might be included in the passive resistance struggle.
I have been unable to comply with their wishes. Whilst, therefore, they
have not been included in the programme of passive resistance, it will
not be denied that some day or other these matters will require further
and sympathetic consideration by the Government. Complete satisfaction cannot be expected until full civic rights have been conceded to
the resident Indian population. I have told my countrymen that they
will have to exercise patience and by all honourable means at their

disposal educate public opinion so as to enable the Government of the
day to go further than the present correspondence does. I shall hope
that, when the Europeans of South Africa fully appreciate the fact that
now, as the importation of indentured labour from India is prohibited
and as the Immigrants Regulation Act of last year has in practice all
but stopped further free Indian immigration and that my countrymen
do not aspire to any political ambition, they, the Europeans, will see
the justice and, indeed, the necessity of my countrymen being granted
the rights I have just referred to.
Meanwhile, if the generous spirit that the Government have
applied to the treatment of the problem during the past few months
continues to be applied, as promised in your letter, in the
administration of the existing laws, I am quite certain that the Indian
community throughout the Union will be able to enjoy some measure
of peace and never be a source of trouble to the Government.1

those who went through these unbearable sufferings. We also owe
thanks to Mr. Kallenbach, Mr. Polak and all other European friends
who have helped us during difficult times.
Speaking on the new Bill, he said:

We could see that the Union Government worked to get the
Assembly and the Senate to pass a Bill which would satisfy the
Imperial Government, the Government of India and the Indians of
South Africa. General Botha, it must be admitted, has done much for
us, seeing that, for the sake of a community as docile as the Indians,
he threatened to resign if the Bill was not passed. We also thank the
Opposition for treating this issue, not as a matter of party-politics, but
as an Imperial problem. We are thankful, too, to the Imperial
Government and to Lord Hardinge, that noble Viceroy of India, for
their help. The help which India gave us under the leadership of Mr.
Gokhale and the invaluable help from Mr. Andrews—each I of these
surpassed the other and it is thanks to them that we have this final and
satisfactory settlement today. The spirit which animated the Government in dealing out justice to us will also inspire the administration of
the Act and, if so, there will be no occasion again for a struggle like
this. But, with their leave, I wish to point out to my countrymen that
the remedy for every hardship lies in the first instance with us; after
that, we have the weapon of satyagraha. . . . I shall for ever cherish the
sacred memory of European friends and the love my countrymen
have borne towards me.

MY DEAR FRIEND AND SEEKER,

First the experiment. My ration was 3 bananas, 4 apples, 2
oranges, 6 naarangi[s], 4 dates, 4 oz. monkey-nuts, 2 spoonful oil and
lemon and orange squash. Had no noises and only one motion for the
whole day well bound. I am looking forward to the result of yours
which is so thorough.
About Joseph, you were hopelessly wrong. You ought to have
bought his ticket- Polak could not be considered. If you did not want
to buy, you should not have taken the money and having failed to do
either, you should have had the courage to give Joseph the real reason
for not buying. It was a lie. Do you think Joseph could not understand? He was quite nice and allowed us to chat away. He was no
disturbing factor. Turn your reading to account. Not until you have
truth in you, will you make real progress. Fear God only. Do not fear
man. Be ever brave but be truthful or do not speak. You could easily
have said, ‘Joseph, and Polak and Gandhi are going to have a private
chat. So better not go but if you must, ask their permission or I cannot
help you to get the ticket’. That would have been gentlemanly and
honest.
Hope Medh sent the wire to Union Castle.
Finish everything without worry.
May God give you strength and courage.
With love,
Yours,

178. SPEECH AT DURBAN MEETING1
[July 5, 1914]
The inference that the Mercury and other papers have drawn
about the £3 tax is altogether wrong and misleading. It does not at all
follow from the Act. After the Mercury’s comments were published,
General Smuts was addressed on the matter, and he is also convinced
that the Act does not bear the meaning which the Mercury has read in
it.2
Speaking on the marriage question, Mr. Gandhi said:

Some Indians have asked for a marriage law similar to the one
in Mauritius. I have, however, read that law; it is worse, on the contrary
[than the law here]. We shall not find anywhere else a better solution
to the marriage problem than the one we have secured.
Proceeding, he said that the issue of the right of entry of South Africa
born Indians into the Cape and the problem of the Orange Free State had also
been satis-factorily settled, and added that the Government had given
assurances for reasonable and lenient administration of the Act. Concluding,
he thanked them for gathering in such large numbers to honour him.

182. LETTER TO HERMANN KALLENBACH
Tuesday [July 7, 1914] 2
MY DEAR FRIEND,

Today I woke up at 4.5 and left the bed at 5.5. Retired last night
at 11 p.m. The food was all uncooked. I had Phoenix oranges and
Phoenix tomatoes. The former were very nice. Mrs. Gandhi feels all
this but is afraid to interfere. She is still pleading with me that I should
take banana chapati.
The extract I sent you yesterday was from Ruskin’s writings.
It is fairly cold here. My packing was practically finished
yesterday. Please tell Medh that after all I shall have to bring
Revashanker with me.
With love,
Yours,

183. LETTER TO E. M. GORGES
P HOENIX,
NATAL ,

July 7, 1914
DEAR MR. GORGES,

I have now got a moment to submit my note upon the Gold
Law. As you know, after maturer consideration, I refrained from
pressing for the insertion of a special clause defining “vested rights”
in connection with the Gold Law and Townships Amendment Act,
because I felt that any definition in the correspondence might result in
restricting the future action of my countrymen. However, so far as my
interpretation of “vested rights” is concerned, I think that I shall
reduce it to writing. General Smuts was good enough to say that he
would endeavour to protect vested rights as defined by me. The
following is the definition I submitted to Sir Benjamin Robertson,
who, I understood, submitted it to General Smuts. My letter 1 containing, among other matters, the definition, is dated the 4th March,
1914. “By ‘vested rights’ I understand the right of an Indian and his
successors to live and trade in the townships in which he was living
and trading, no matter how often he shifts his residence or business
from place to place in the same township.” I am fortified in my
interpretation by the answer given by Mr. Harcourt in connection with
the matter, in the House of Commons, on the 27th June, 1911:
Complaints against that legislation (the Gold Law and Townships
Amendment Act) have been made and are now being investigated by the
Government of the Union of South Africa, who have lately stated that
there is no intention of interfering with any business or right to carry on
business acquired and exercised by Indians prior to the date of the legislation.

I have also now traced the note by Mr. de Villiers which I
alluded to in our conversation. It is contained in a White Paper
published in London in March, 1912, and has the following:
No right or privilege which a Coloured person has at the present time is
taken away by the new Act (Act 35 of 1908).

And again,
Section 131, which, before the Billas introduced into Parliament,
formed the subject of questions in the English House of Commons and of
despatches from the Secretary of State to the Governor, has been amended in
Committee so as to safeguard any rights which a Coloured person may, at the
present time, have of occupying land in mining areas.

Certainly, prior to the passing of the Gold Law, no restrictions
were, to my knowledge, placed upon the movement or the trade of
British Indians in the Gold Areas. There can, therefore, be no
justification for any restriction now, especially in regard to those who
are already settled in their respective townships.
I am,
Yours truly,

184. SPEECH AT FAREWELL MEETING1
DURBAN,

July 8, 1914
Mr. Gandhi, in returning thanks, first explained why he appeared in the
mourning costume which he had been wearing since the time of the strike.2 He hoped
they would forgive him for appearing in that strange costume, which he had adopted
on his premature discharge from prison, as a sign of mourning. That mourning had
gone, yet he retained the costume, and as the alternative was for him to wear evening
1

A large and enthusiastic meeting of Indians, attended by a number of Europeans, was held in the Town Hall to bid farewell to Gandhiji, Kasturba and Kallenbach
on the eve of their departure for England en route to India. W. Holmes, the Mayor,
presided. Gandhiji and Ba were garlanded and presented with bouquets. Kallenbach
could not attend and a telegram from him expressing thanks was read at the meeting.
Addresses on behalf of a number of organizations all over South Africa were read.
Indian and European admirers of Gandhiji paid him glowing tributes. Gandhiji then
addressed the meeting. This report of Gandhiji’s speech has been collated with the
one appearing in The Natal Mercury, 9-7-1914.

The Natal Mercury reported: “Mr. Gandhi who appeared in Hindu mourning
costume, and was received with prolonged cheering, began with a reference to the
object of his appearing in the dress he wore that night.”

dress, he felt that, in the mental attitude which possessed him at that moment, he
could not render a greater respect for them than in appearing as he did. (Cheers.)
Referring to the addresses which had been presented to him, he said that, while he
valued them, he valued more the love and sympathy which the addresses had
expressed. He did not know that he would be able to make adequate compensation. He
did not deserve all the praise bestowed upon him. Nor did his wife claim to deserve all
that had been said of her. Many an Indian woman had done greater service during the
struggle than Mrs. Gandhi. He thanked the community on behalf of Mr. Kallenbach,
who was another brother to him, for the addresses presented. The community had done
well in recognizing Mr. Kallenbach’s worth. Mr. Kallenbach would tell them that he
came to the struggle to gain. He considered that, by taking up their cause, he gained a
great deal in the truest sense. Mr. Kallenbach had done splendid work during the strike
at Newcastle and, when the time came, he cheerfully went to prison, again thinking
that he was the gainer and not the loser. Proceeding, Mr. Gandhi referred to the time
of his arrival in 1897 when his friend Mr. Laughton had stood by him against the
mob. 1 He also remembered with gratefulness the action of Mrs. Alexander, the wife of
the late Superintendent of Police in Durban, who protected him with her umbrella
from the missiles thrown by the excited crowd. Referring to passive resistance, he
claimed that it was a weapon of the purest type. It was not the weapon of the weak. It
needed, in his opinion, far greater courage to be a passive resister than a physical
resister. It was the courage of a Jesus, a Daniel, a Cranmer, a Latimer and a Ridley who
could go calmly to suffering and death, and the courage of a Tolstoy who dared to defy
the Czars of Russia, that stood out as the greatest. Mr. Gandhi said he knew the Mayor
had received some telegrams stating that the Indians’ Relief Bill was not
satisfactory. 2 It would be a singular thing if in this world they would be able to get
anything that satisfied everybody, but, in the condition of things in South Africa at
the present time, he was certain they could not have had a better measure.

I do not claim the credit for it. It is rather due to the women and
children and young people like Nagappen, Narayansamy, and
Valliamah who have died for the cause and to those who quickened
the conscience of South Africa. Our thanks are due also to the Union
Government. I shall never forget that General Botha showed the
greatest statesmanship when he said his Government would stand or
fall by this measure. I followed the whole of that historic debate—
historic to me, historic to my countrymen, and possibly historic to
South Africa and the world.

resistance which he described as the cleanest weapon they could use.”

Proceeding, Mr. Gandhi said that it was well known to them how the
Government had done justice, and how the Opposition had come to their assistance.
They had also received handsome help from both the Imperial and The manner in
which India, led by their great and distinguished countryman, Mr. Gokhale, had
responded to the cry which came from the hearts of thousands of their countrymen in
South Africa was one of the results of the passive resistance movement, and left, he
hoped, no bitter traces or bitter memories. (Applause.)

This assurance I wish to give. I go away with no ill-will against a
European. I have received many hard knocks in my life, but here I
admit that I have received those most precious gifts from
Europeans—love and sympathy. (Cheers.)
This settlement, he said, had been achieved after an eight years’ struggle.
The Indians in South Africa had never aspired to any political ambition, and as
regards the social question, that could never arise in connection with the Indians.

I do not hold for one moment that East and West cannot
combine. I think the day is coming when East must meet West, or West
meet East, but I think the social evolution of the West today lies in one
channel, and that of the Indian in another channel. The Indians have
no wish today to encroach on the social institutions of the European
in South Africa. (Cheers.) Most Indians are natural traders. There are
bound to be trade jealousies and those various things that come from
competition. I have never been able to find a solution of this most
difficult problem, which will require the broad-mindedness and spirit
of justice of the Government of South Africa to hold the balance
between conflicting interests.
Referring to his stay in South Africa, Mr. Gandhi said that he should retain the
most sacred memories of this land. He had been fortunate in forming the happiest and
most lasting friendship with both Europeans and Indians. He was now returning to
India—a holy land, sanctified by the austerities of the ages. In conclusion, Mr.
Gandhi said, he hoped that the same love and sympathy which had been given to him
in South Africa might be extended to him, no matter in what part of the world he
might be. He hoped that the settlement embodied in the Indians’ Relief Bill would be
carried out in a spirit of broad-mindedness and justice in the administration of the
laws lately passed in connection with the affairs of the Indian community.

Then, I think there will be no fear on the part of my countrymen in their social evolution. That is one of the lessons of the settlement.1

185. THE END
A struggle of eight years’ duration has at last finally closed. The
Indians’ Relief Bill and the correspondence1 between the Government
and Mr. Gandhi embody a complete and mutually satisfactory and
honourable settlement of the problems that were affected by the
passive resistance movement. For this happy ending we have to thank
the Imperial, Indian and Union Governments, the Motherland, guided
and moved by Mr. Gokhale, and Mr. Andrews’ mission. The sufferings of thousands of Passive Resisters, the martyrdom of Valliamah,
Narayansamy, Nagappen and Harbatsingh brought these forces into
being. Passive Resistance, as a lawful weapon, has thus once more been
vindicated. The lengthy reference made by Lord Gladstone to the
settlement shows its importance. We are grateful to His Excellency for
clearly placing before the people of South Africa the Imperial aspect.
It now remains for the Union Government to follow up this
happy solution of a difficult problem by a sympathetic and just
administration of the laws that affect the Indian community and for
the latter to show by its action that it is ever worthy of just treatment.
If the community is permitted to enjoy rest, it will be possible to find
an easy method of dealing with the matters dealt with in Mr. Gandhi’s
letter and which some day or other will demand attention in order that
the resident population may be restored to the ordinary rights of
citizenship. For it must not be forgotten that, though there is cause for
thankfulness in that the most pressing grievances have been removed,
we shall still labour under legal disabilities which intense colour
prejudice has brought into being. Administration of trade licence laws,
largely on racial lines, the deprivation of the right to own land in the
Transvaal, the precarious position under the Transvaal Gold Law,
inter-provincial restrictions—these and many other such limitations of
our liberty show how true were Lord Gladstone’s words when he said
that the Indians’ Relief Bill did but the barest justice. Indeed, it can
only be taken as an instalment and as an earnest of the future. The
struggle will, therefore, have done much more than give us the Bill
and the administrative measures, if it has also altered the repressive
policy of the Government to a progressive one, such that we may look
forward to a steady improvement in the future.

186. THE END OF THE STRUGGLE
The struggle that went on for eight years has come to an end,
and such an end as, we believe, hardly any other movement in modern
times has been crowned with. The foundation of the struggle was laid
in Johannesburg in September, 1906. The issue then concerned only
the Registration Act. The Government refused to listen to us. Gaolgoing was resorted to. While the struggle had not yet ended, the
Immigration Act was passed. A conditional settlement followed. The
Government failed to honour its commitment. The movement was
revived and had to beextended to cover the effect of the Immigration
Act on the Registration Act. A new issue was thus added, that there
should be no racial discrimination in the Immigration Act. Naturally,
our feelings were aroused still further in consequence. The struggle
was prolonged and a second deputation went to England.1 The Union
Government, however, refused in so many words to remove the racial
discrimination. While the struggle was thus being prolonged, in 1911
again a provisional settlement came about. This covered a third issue.
Since a problem created by a law of the Transvaal had to be solved by
the Union Parliament, the satyagrahis took the stand that they could
not accept legislation which, though it might meet their requirement,
would endanger the rights of others. Accordingly, a condition was
included in the provisional settlement of 1911 to the effect that the
existing rights of Indians in all the parts of the Union should be left
untouched. There was no decision, however, until 1913. In the
meantime, there was the visit of Mr. Gokhale. The Government gave
him a promise that the £3 tax would be removed. Even so, had the
Government granted the satyagrahis’ demands in full during the
settlement in 1913, the movement would not have been revived and
the £3 tax would have had to be taken up as a separate issue.
Meanwhile, the Searle judgment raised the marriage question.
This also entailed the loss of existing rights. In 1913, the late Mr. Fischer carried through the Immigration Act in the face of our protests.
It conceded much, but also denied a few things. The marriage question was left unsolved and in other ways, too, existing rights were
endangered. This led to the resumption of satyagraha a fourth time
1

204

This was in 1909.
THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

and our demands naturally increased. Now that the Government has
had to concede all the demands, the struggle has ended.
We can see from this, if we will, that every time the Government went back on its word, it was obliged to yield more to us. This it
is which makes one say that chicanery never pays. Double dealing
may remain unexposed only where both sides play more or less the
same [dirty] game. In satyagraha, one side alone plays this game. The
satyagrahi himself cannot conceivably do so.
We can also see that the more the struggle was prolonged the
greater became the strength of the people and their capacity to suffer,
so that the suffering that the masses endured towards the end of the
last year was unparalleled in modern history. And, if the suffering has
been great, the relief obtained has also been proportionately great.
This correlation goes to prove another eternal law of Nature. Man can
be happy only in the measure that he suffers. He who merely scrapes
the soil on the surface can harvest nothing but grass. He alone can
harvest grain who ploughs deeper. In other words, it is vain to hope
for happiness without undergoing suffering. Thus it is that the life of
austerity, the fakir’s self-denial and other such practices have everywhere been held in high esteem and their praises sung.
What the community has bought at the cost of so much suffering it will be able to keep and add to, only so long as it retains the
same capacity for suffering. If it loses that capacity, it will lose all it
has gained, and more. All this is plain enough, but we often lose sight
of it.
NEW ACT

Let us now have a look at our gains. The new Act covers two
things. In the first place, the £3 tax has been abolished. Arrears have
also been remitted. In this connection, it has been suggested by The
[Natal] Mercury and other papers that in gaining one thing we have
lost something else; for, though the Government has repealed the tax,
the consequence will be that the indentured labourers, poor creatures,
will be obliged to leave this country or continue for ever under indenture. This suggestion is entirely unfounded, as is clear from General
Smuts’ own letter. The other point is about the marriage question.
The manner in which it has been solved gives us more, not less, than
what we had been demanding. This Act confirms the position that was
believed to obtain before the Searle judgment. Prior to that judgment,
we had assumed that the local law recognized monogamous marriages
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

205

celebrated under any faith, including marriages solemnized under our
rites. Mr. Justice Searle, however, ruled otherwise and held that
Christian marriages could be recognized but not Hindu and Muslim
marriages, even if such marriages were in fact monogamous. This was
obviously an affront to the two religions. Mr. Cachalia therefore
desired amendment of the law. The demand has now been met. The
Act does not involve any other change. The position with regard to
divorce, inheritance and polygamy remains what it was. The Act
safeguards the interests of children by a deceased wife. Its provisions
are permissive. No one is obliged to have his or her marriage
registered. As for those coming from India, the question just does not
arise. The main object of getting a marriage registered is to ensure
that children’s interests do not suffer. Now that the danger has been
removed, it is not necessary for any Indian to have his or her marriage
registered. We would rather advise them not to do so. The situation
required a [new] law. It was necessary to undo the affront to [our]
religions. It should be sufficient that we have succeeded in this. The
Act has been so drafted as to secure children’s interests without
requiring registration of the marriages. In view of this, the question
whether a marriage is monogamous or polygamous will not arise at
all. In any case, one who intends to marry more than one woman,
would do well not to have his marriage with any of them registered. It
was necessary to have provisions made for appointment of our priests
as marriage officers. But we would not advise that this right be availed
of. We are of the view that such appointments will lead to dishonesty
in the community and expose the priests to temptations. As for
marriages already solemnized, there is no need for such appointments
since these marriages can be registered before any magistrate. It is the
same with regard to marriages that may be celebrated in future. In
other words, we can have a marriage solemnized by any Maulvi 1 or
Gor2 and get it registered subsequently before a magistrate whenever
we choose. We would, there-fore, particularly advise the community,
not to take the trouble of getting marriage officers appointed. Before
we leave this point, it has to be said that in no other Colony does a
[marriage] law go as far as the one passed here does. It has been said
that in Mauritius [Indian] marriages are recognized whether
polygamous or not, but this is not true and the law there is not as good
1
2

206

Hindu priest
THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

as the one here, as we show elsewhere in this very issue.
A third point that has been satisfactorily settled in this Act is
that, in case of any doubt regarding the domicile certificate of a
resident of Natal, the certificate must be accepted as genuine if the
thumb-impression on it is identical with the one on the copy in
possession of the Immigration Officer. The result will be that people
will not be unneces-sarily harassed, as at present, with inquiries and
sent away for making false claims in spite of the genuineness of the
thumb-impression having been established. Those who can prove the
thumb-impression to be genuine have their right secured now. This
section does not however mean that one who has been away from
Natal for a number of years will, just because he has the [domicile]
certificate, be safe. Everyone, of course, will have to prove that he had
not left Natal for good.
ADMINISTRATIVE R ELIEF

The kind of ameliorative measures needed outside the law can
be judged from the correspondence between the Government and Mr.
Gandhi. These concern issues such as South African Indians, the Free
State and the administration of existing laws. Only one of these points
calls for comment here. In view of the promise of reasonable administration of the laws in force, with due regard to existing rights, it will be
possible for the community to obtain redress in every case of
injustice. This clause, we believe, should prove very useful in future.
But its usefulness will depend on how the community’s leaders exert
them-selves. If they sleep on, the clause will have been passed in vain.
The laws which will most need to be watched are two: the licensing law
in each Province and the Gold Law of the Transvaal. Mr. Gandhi has
pointed out in his letter that we shall have to agitate in future to secure
amendment of these laws. In starting any such agitation, the
community will have to be particularly careful in obeying the laws in
question; if it does so, it will, for the present at any rate, enjoy peace.
We must admit that on this occasion the Government have displayed a desire for justice and that the leading members of Parliament
have also been actuated by the same desire in their speeches. It would
also appear from the speeches of the ministers, and especially from
that of General Smuts, that he is inclined to deal justly in future. We
advise the community to profit by this desire, and this it will be able to

do only if it has unity, manly spirit and regard for truth.

187. MARRIAGE LAW IN MAURITIUS
We had heard that in Mauritius the law recognized polygamous
marriages in the case of Indians. Thereupon we made inquiries. We
have not received a copy of the Act. This law was the result of
agitation by Indians there. It was passed on December 17, 1912. It
provides for the appointment of Hindu and Muslim priests as marriage officers. No Indian marriage is to be recognized as valid unless
it complies with the provisions of the Act of 1890. That is, the general
law which applies to all applies to our people also. It is specifically
mentioned in that general law that the provisions of sections 46 to 51
regulating marriages also apply to Indian marriages. If the husband is
below 21 years and the wife below 18, the consent of the parents of
both is necessary. There are other sections prescribing the duties and
functions of marriage officers, the manner of maintaining registers,
etc. Violation of any of the provisions or registration of an unlawful
marriage is punishable with a fine up to Rs. 500/-. The following are
some of the conditions to be observed by priests under this Act:
l.
A boy under the age of 18 and a girl under 15 cannot be
married except by special permission of the Governor.
2.

If one wife is living, marriage with another woman cannot
be contracted unless the former is lawfully divorced.

3.

In case of divorce for adultery, the divorced party cannot
marry the partner in such adultery.

4.

A widow or divorced woman cannot remarry until after ten
months.

5.

No marriages can take place between a man and his niece, a
woman and her nephew, and man and his brother’s wife,
even where the woman is a widow.

Besides these, there are many other provisions which, how ever,
we do not notice here.
What we have given above shows that the general law in
Mauritius is applicable to Indians in regard to divorce, polygamous

marriages, the minimum age for marriage and such other essential
matters. The only change introduced by the new law is that, whereas
Indian priests could not register marriages formerly, such priests can
be appointed now for that purpose.

Africa and to them his last words would be when he left it. It was they who had assisted him with his first piece of political work in South Africa, when a petition signed
by some 10,000 Indians had been addressed to Lord Elgin, the then Secretary of State
for the Colonies, 1 against the disfranchisement of Indians. That petition had been
successful in its object, the Bill being vetoed, though the Government of the day
subsequently in another form achieved its purpose. The Colonial-borns had since also
borne their share of the communal work, but they could, if they would, do more. It was
they who were the permanent Indian settlers of South Africa. To the Colonial-borns
South Africa was their birth-place and home, and it was essential to the well being of
all other sections of the community that they should work together with the Colonial-borns. Their responsibility was great. It was they who would have to nurse the
settlement, to maintain the happier tone which had now been established between the
European and Indian communities and to live down the prejudice which today still
existed in South Africa. This they would accomplish in time if they did their duty at
all times. He referred to the fact that Nagappen and Valiamma had both been Colonial-borns, as had the ladies who did such noble work at Newcastle. He urged upon
them to preserve their national characteristic, to learn their mother-tongue and study
the history and traditions of their Motherland, where he would hope to see them some
day.

The rich were busy getting richer. My brother Nagappen and sister
Valliamma were born here, and so was brother Narayansamy. I would
urge you all to follow in their footsteps and advise you to go on a
pilgrimage to India, be the difficulties what they might.3

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

I am grateful to you all, friends, for the honour and the love that
you have given us both. Whenever I am honoured, I feel my atman is
exposed to danger. Whenever, on the contrary, I am attacked or
insulted, I realize my imperfections and a new light dawns upon me.
In my present state of mind, however, I am not at all likely to be
corrupted by praise of me. I feel extremely sad to have to part from
you, but sooner or later that was bound to happen. I am about to leave
a bhoga-bhumi 1 for a karma-bhumi2 . For me there can be no
deliverance from this earthly life except in India. Anyone who seeks
such deliverance must go to the sacred soil of India. For me, as for
everyone else, the land of India is “the refuge of the afflicted”. I am
therefore longing to return to the motherland. It is my parting prayer
that you should all bear love for one another, regardless of caste or
creed.
I have always shown the same respect for Muslims as for
Hindus. Hinduism, too, teaches this [regard for other religions], and if
anyone says that in this I am not acting like a Hindu, I shall offer
satyagraha against him. I make bold to say that certainly no
onepresent here is more of a Hindu than I am, perhaps not even as
much. Whenever we have a guest, we show due respect to him. We
ought to respect members of other communities in the same manner.
If every Indian lived thus in amity with others, there is not the slightest
doubt that we shall make great advance in South Africa.
As to the honour that has been done to me on this occasion, I
have only this to say, that every time I have been honoured I have felt
particularly weak and that when I have received blows I have felt
accession of strength and progressed towards greater firmness of
mind. Those friends, therefore, who speak ill of me these days are, to
judge from results, my well-wishers. I shall have been rightly honoured only when every friend becomes a satyagrahi.

191. SPEECH AT SPORTS FUNCTION1
DURBAN,

[July 9, 1914]
Mr. Gandhi said that he was deeply grateful to the Farewell Committee for
having organised those sports and for having set apart that day for the sake of the
Indian children and gathered them together at that short notice, and he must confess
that he was not at all equally grateful for the function that they had in the Town Hall.2
For him that had been insipid, but that function that afternoon would carry with it or
would send with him the pleasandest recollections of his stay in South Africa. He
knew the community of South Africa, but he scarcely knew the community of India.
He felt confidand that if he wanded to give a knowledge to anybody as to how the
lndian mind in South Africa would run on a particular occasion, he should be able to
state accurately the direction in which it would go, but he had no knowledge at all as
to what the Indian mind in India itself could do or would do on a particular occasion.
To that extent he knew his countrymen in South Africa, and it gave him very great
pleasure that afternoon to see those around him when he was about to say good-bye to
South Africa and to say good-bye to his dear countrymen and to all those boys and
girls. He then addressed the children. He said they had come there that afternoon to
indulge in sports, and sports were good, they were excellent, if they knew the
meaning of those sports, but he would leave those alone that afternoon and would like
to direct their attention to the real sport in life. They had raced for prizes and, as Mr.
Baillie had just reminded him, the prize-giving might have a demoralising effect upon
those who had the training of the children in their hands as well as upon the children
themselves. He shared that fear, but, if they had raced that afternoon for the sake of
racing in order to show that during the past few years they had been endeavouring to
keep the physical portion of their being in a fit and proper state, it showed also the
value of the industry, the courage and the time that they had put forth in a disciplined
manner in order to gain that particular purpose in life. But in life there was a better
race for them and for him to run—did they know what that race was? All the children
who went to churches if they were Christians, or all the children who were Hindus if
they had any Hindus to teach them what their own religion taught, or if they were
Mahomedans and had priests to tell them, he felt sure that they would all tell them
that there was that race in life where they had to make themselves good in future and
behave themselves if they grew up as men and women. In his opinion, if he might

address a few remarks to the teachers also, having played at teaching himself for a
number of years, it seemed to him that the real teaching consisted not in giving the
children a knowledge of letters merely, but in developing their character, and that, in
so far as the boys and girls developed their character whilst they were still tender and
whilst they could still be moulded, and, if their teachers told them that character was
the first, the middle and the last and that their knowledge of letters was purely and
simply an aid to develop that character, then he thought that they were doing well in
attending those schools and it was well for their parents also [to allow them] to do
that; but, if their parents sent them, if they went to schools, merely to have a
knowledge of letters, so that they might earn a few pounds anyhow in future, then he
was afraid that their education was not education and he felt that he should say that
little word to them that afternoon.
Presently they were going to receive prizes, but they had been told that the
Sporting Association of the Natal Province was about to receive a wandering trophy
from Mr. Rustomjee, and he understood that it was not a trophy which was intrinsically valueless, but that it had actually cost a sum of over £30. He hoped that the
Natal Sporting Association deserved that trophy, but he did not dwell upon the trophy
because it was a valuable thing, but he did hope that the Natal Sporting Association
would behave in a sportsmanlike spirit, and in that real sport in the world and in that
race in life would set a noble example to the children, the boys and girls who had
gathered together there that afternoon, by gaining trophies not from one Parsee
Rustomjee but from everyone of their countrymen in South Africa by placing
themselves at their disposal and by serving them in a sportsmanlike manner. And,
even as these schools had run the races and put their whole spirit into the race, so he
hoped that the Association would do so, and he thought that they had given him an
earnest of what they were doing from the manner in which they had conducted those
proceedings, because it was, he thought, on their shoulders that the brunt of the
burden had fallen, led as they had been and still were by Mr. Rustomjee. And one word
for Mr. Rustomjee. Friend though he was to him, client though he had been to him,
trustee though he was of the Phoenix Settlement, he did wish to commend to them the
services of Mr. Rustomjee. He knew that he had worked himself practically to death in
connection with that farewell, but he did hope it had not been because a friend of his
was going away from South Africa, but in order to show what they had got to do in
South Africa, in order to show that South Africa had a reputation, or the Indians in
South Africa had, in keeping up the reputation of the Motherland, and he showed also
by his energy and by his supporting all such movements what they had got to do. He
knew that Mr. Rustomjee was at times hard to please. But if they did please him, he
(the speaker) knew also that they had no better, no more constand, leader to work
with in South Africa. Mr. Rustomjee knew no distinction of race or religion. He was a
Parsee among Parsees, but also a Mahomedan among Mahomedans in that he would do
VOL. 14: 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

213

for them, die for them, live for them. He was a Hindu amongst Hindus and would do for
them likewise. There were many others whom he (the speaker) might point out in
South Africa who could equal Mr. Rustomjee in many respects and surpass him, but
none his equal in constancy and courage. And before he left the Port of Durban, he
would leave that parting word with them. If there was anything of public work to be
done, let them trust Mr. Rustomjee, but let them also obey him. They should bear
with Mr. Rustomjee, but also with his faults. There was no human being without
faults. Even the sun and moon had spots. God alone was spotless; it was not given to
any mortal being to be spotless. Let Mr. Rustomjee’s faults take care of themselves,
and let them see his merits, and they knew what he had been to them during the
gigandic strike. In conclusion, he asked them to pray for him, to give their love to
him, and send him nice messages, and, in return, he promised that, in whatever part of
the world he might be, he would not forget his countryman with whom he had mixed
in South Africa and how they had loved him, and he prayed that God might give him
strength to love them in return. God alone knew him and could see his heart. It may be
that he had loved them wisely, it might be that he had loved them ignorandly, and
thereby performed a service or disservice to them; then, God was also great enough to
forgive him, but they should also forgive him if he had not loved them well enough,
served them well enough, but knew that all he had done and endeavoured to do had
been done from the bottom of his heart. Mistakes he had committed, for which they
should pardon him. But if they had seen traces of love in him, let them pray to the
Almighty that that love might grow abundandly and come forth to them also as some
poor return of the love and generosity and consideration they had shown to him and
Mrs. Gandhi in their darkest hours.

my inability to accept it owing to pressure on my time. Had I known
their caste, I would have certainly come earlier. I feel proud that I am
now meeting [members of] this caste. They are our own brethren, and

unworthiness but is morally wrong, for it is contrary to the teaching of
the Bhagavad Gita.
Mr. Gandhi then explained how the training of children’s character was far
more importand than literary education. They might learn less, but the education they
received would have some meaning only if they understood what they learnt.

MY DEAR FRIEND,

I have your letter today. This time I do not want to miss a single
day if I can help it.
I have here your waistcoats and trousers which I am bringing
with me as also your papers.
Yesterday and today I have not been able to get up early having
retired after midnight. The functions in Durban compelled me to take
only the 9.30 p.m. train from Durban. The temptation to take cooked
fruit was great but it is finished now. I am not likely to succumb
between tomorrow and Sunday. Here is the train coming so good-bye.
With love,

management of his office, but there had been no personal ill-will on the speaker’s
part, and he always received the utmost courtesy at Mr. Chamney’s hands. He
appreciated the compliment Mr. Chamney paid him by coming out to arrest him with
one man only to assist, when the speaker was at the head of 2,000 men and women. It
showed the confidence Mr. Chamney had in him as a passive resister. He thanked
them for the purse, the contents of which, in common with those of any others
received, would not be used for himself, but first for the furtherance of the interests of
the Indians of South Africa, and, secondly, for any work he might have to do in India
which had commended itself to them in the course of the conversations they had had.
He felt that the settlement they had received was a kind of Magna Charta. It was not a
final settlement in the sense that they had no wrongs left. They had to exercise patience and cultivate European opinion, in order to get those wrongs redressed. They had
to maintain the sympathy which men like Mr. Stent might think fit to extend to
them. He paid a glowing tribute to the work done for the Indian cause by Miss
Schlesin.

PASSIVE RESISTANCE
[Before July 11, 1914] 1
I shall be at least far away from Phoenix, if not actually in the
Motherland, when this Commemoration Issue is published.2 I would,
however, leave behind me my innermost thoughts upon that which has
made this special issue necessary. Without Passive Resistance, there
would have been no richly illustrated and importand special issue of
Indian Opinion, which has, for the last eleven years, in an unpretentious and humble manner, endeavoured to serve my countrymen and
South Africa, a period covering the most critical stage that they will,
perhaps, ever have to pass through. It marks the rise and growth of
Passive Resistance, which has attracted world-wide attention. The term
does not fit the activity of the Indian community during the past eight
years. Its equivalent in the vernacular,3 rendered into English, means

Truth-Force. I think Tolstoy called it also Soul-Force or Love-Force,
and so it is. Carried out to its utmost limit, this force is independent of
pecuniary or other material assistance; certainly, even in its elementary
form, of physical force or violence. Indeed, violence is the negation of
this great spiritual force, which can only be cultivated or wielded by
those who will entirely eschew violence. It is a force that may be used
by individuals as well as by communities. It may be used as well in
political as in domestic affairs. Its universal applicability is a demonstration of its permanence and invincibility. It can be used alike by
men, women, and children. It is totally untrue to say that it is a force
to be used only by the weak so long as they are not capable of
meeting violence by violence. This superstition arises from the
incompleteness of the English expression. It is impossible for those
who consider themselves to be weak to apply this force. Only those
who realise that there is something in man which is superior to the
brute nature in him, and that the latter always yields to it, can
effectively be Passive Resisters. This force is to violence and, therefore,
to all tyranny, all injustice, what light is to darkness. In politics, its use
is based upon the immutable maxim that government of the people is
possible only so long as they consent either consciously or unconsciously to be governed. We did not wand to be governed by the
Asiatic Act of 1907 of the Transvaal, and it had to go before this
mighty force. Two courses were open to us—to use violence when we
were called upon to submit to the Act, or to suffer the penalties
prescribed under the Act, and thus to draw out and exhibit the force
of the soul within us for a period long enough to appeal to the
sympathetic chord in the governors or the law-makers. We have taken
long to achieve what we set about striving for. That was because our
Passive Resistance was not of the most complete type. All Passive
Resisters do not understand the full value of the force, nor have we
men who always from conviction refrain from violence. The use of
this force requires the adoption of poverty, in the sense that we must
be indifferent whether we have the wherewithal to feed or clothe
ourselves. During the past struggle, all Passive Resisters, if any at all,
were not prepared to go that length. Some again were only Passive
Resisters so-called. They came without any conviction, often with
mixed motives, less often with impure motives. Some even, whilst
engaged in the struggle, would gladly have resorted to violence but
for most vigiland supervision. Thus it was that the struggle became
prolonged; for the exercise of the purest soul-force, in its perfect
VOL. 14: 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

217

form, brings about instandaneous relief. For this exercise, prolonged
training of the individual soul is an absolute necessity, so that a perfect
Passive Resister has to be almost, if not entirely, a perfect man. We
cannot all suddenly become such men, but, if my proposition is
correct—as I know it to be correct—the greater the spirit of Passive
Resistance in us, the better men we will become. Its use, therefore, is, I
think; indisputable, and it is a force which, if it became universal,
would revolutionise social ideals and do away with despotisms and the
ever-growing militarism under which the nations of the West are
groaning and are being almost crushed to death, and which fairly
promises to overwhelm even the nations of the East. If the past
struggle has produced even a few Indians who would dedicate themselves to the task of becoming Passive Resisters as nearly perfect as
possible, they would not only have served themselves in the truest
sense of the term, they would also have served humanity at large. Thus
viewed, Passive Resistance is the noblest and the best education. It
should come, not after the ordinary education in letters of children,
but it should precede it. It will not be denied that a child, before it
begins to write its alphabet and to gain worldly knowledge, should
know what the soul is, what truth is, what love is, what powers are latent
in the soul. It should be an essential of real education that a child
should learn that, in the struggle of life, it can easily conquer hate by
love, untruth by truth, violence by self-suffering. It was because I felt
the force of this truth, that, during the latter part of the struggle, I
endeavoured, as much as I could, to train the children at Tolstoy Farm
and then at Phoenix along these lines, and one of the reasons for my
departure to India is still further to realise, as I already do in part, my
own imperfection as a Passive Resister, and then to try to perfect
myself, for I believe that it is in India that the nearest approach to
perfection is most possible.

196. SPEECH AT DURBAN BANQUET1
[July 11, 1914]
Mr. Gandhi thanked those present for the hearty way they had received the
toast. Amid all the kind words that had been spoken of him, there was a danger of
developing a swollen head. When much praise was being bestowed, that was the time
to beware. Speaking of the Settlement, he said that, whilst it was a settlement of the
present difficulties, it was not a complete settlement. It was not a charter of full
liberties. 2 There were many questions which would require patience to solve. One of
these was the licensing question. He had never been able to find a solution. It would
need much tact and a sense of justice on the part of the Government and a desire to
meet all the requirements of sanitary and building by-laws on the part of the Indian
community. A certain class of Indians were born traders and if these people were to be
driven from their means of livelihood, a serious position would arise. The value of the
settlement lay in the struggle which preceded it—a struggle which quickened the
conscience of South Africa—and the fact that there was a different tone prevailing
to-day. (Hear, hear.) It would rest upon themselves to keep up that tone. That which
they had gained was but a portion of that which they had to gain. Speaking generally
of the opposition with which they were faced, he said that, although there was great
prejudice, in his opinion, unreasonable and unjustifiable, there was also a spirit of
justice behind that prejudice. 3 He appealed to his fellow-countrymen to exercise
patience and try to live down prejudices which were against them. They had not
received all they were entitled to, but it depended very largely upon themselves
whether they received in the future a full measure of justice. Referring to the
Provincial barrier, he said that the Union was no Union for them so long as they were
confined within their own Province. They appealed for and should have freedom of
movement no matter to what Province they desired to go. In conclusion, Mr. Gandhi
spoke of the British Constitution and ideals, and remarked that so long as both were
retained as they were, and the traditions maintained then it was a good thing, but evil
would be the day when the Constitution crumbled, and its ideal was changed.
1

A pubic dinner in honour of Gandhiji at Durban was attended by the Mayor,
other prominent Europeans and about 30 Indians. Addresses were presented to
Gandhiji and Miss Schlesin on behalf of the Farewell Committee. The Hon. Robert
Jameson, J.P., presided.
2
The report in The Natal Mercury, 13-7-1914, added here: “Many things had
been given up, and in return they had received only a portion.”
3
The Natal Mercury reported Gandhiji as having said here: “The trading
question was a big one, and in order that the community should live in peace, it would
be a question that would have to be settled on amicable and just lines.”

(Applause). Although he was going home to India which was dear to him, he
assuredthem that he would never forget South Africa, and next to the homeland it
would be nearest his thoughts. (Applause.)
Mr. Gandhi again rose, on behalf of Miss Schlesin, to thank the donors of the
address and set of books presented to her. He said that Miss Schlesin had played a
great part in the passive resistance movement. She had worked night and day and
thrown herself heartily into the work. She had not hesitated even to court imprisonment but that was denied her. For many years she had acted as his secretary and
rendered valuable assistance to him in his public work, but she was also no less than a
sister to him. She had organised the Transvaal Indian Women’s Association and had
acted, since its inauguration, as honorary secretary.1
The Chairman (the Hon. R. Jameson) had recalled an instance which he (the
speaker) thought he might have forgotten, and that was when the scene was laid in his
office and he had approached him tremblingly, but also in the fullest faith, that he
was a friend of the community, that he had guided him, as he well said, as a father
would guide his child, in many things which he wanded to do as a humble burgess of
that beautiful borough, the garden of South Africa. He had approached him first with
that proposal of his in connection with the offer of forming an ambulance corps and
he, naturally, as a soldier, had put a damper on his enthusiasm. He had uttered words of
caution. The speaker had gone away chastened but he had gone to another friend. He
did not know whether he was a soldier, but he knew that he was an Imperialist and also
that he had a kindly corner in his heart for him— Mr. Laughton. His eyes beaming
with delight, because he had never thought that the Indians could ever make any such
offer, he had said, never mind what Jameson said, he should make the offer and he
would see that the Government would probably accept it, but even if they did not, his
countrymen would rise in the estimation of the Colonists of Natal. That sealed their
fate. The offer was made and was rejected. He went over to Dr. Booth who was then in
charge of St. Aidan’s Mission and asked him whether he would give them ambulance
lessons. He formed the class and gave them those lessons for three or four weeks.
They continued to have them. Most of those who made the offer were Colonial-born
Indians. Just then they all had the fear that the enemy, now the friends of the British
Empire, were descending upon Maritzburg and finally might take the Port of
Durban also. The offer, was renewed, this time with better hope. Dr. Booth went over
to the Bishop of Natal,2 who intervened—and he would not take no for an answer—
till at last the offer was not only accepted, but they were able to form a very
decentStretcher-bearer Corps which, as they all knew, did its humble share. If he had

dealt with that matter in some detail, it was in order to render a humble tribute to the
European friends and to say that at that time, as on many other occasions, there had
been a perfect blending, a perfect harmony and a perfectly friendly tone, that at that
time they were not without European sympathy and without European friends. With
what a heavy heart, then, would he leave South Africa when he had all those rich
memories. If he dwelt upon that incident, he also dwelt upon it in order to show to his
countrymen that, if they always clamoured for their rights, if they always wanded to
resist any encroachment upon their rights, they had also to recognize their
obligations as members of a state. That was an occasion which offered itself for such
a recognition on the part of the Indian community, and though they had been only a
few thousand, he thought that they had done whatever it was in their power to do, and
he wished to remind his countrymen of that occasion and wished them to understand
that the settlement also carried with it obligations.1

197. SPEECH AT VERULAM2
July 12, 1914
BROTHERS AND SISTERS,

When I agreed to come over to Verulam, I had no idea in my
mind that I would receive an address. I came only to pay homage to
my indentured brothers and to explain to them the facts under the
new law. Moreover, a visit to this place is for me like going on a
pilgrimage, for the Indian friends here played a great part in the
recent strike; and in what wonderful a manner! When all the so-called
leaders were resting in their private rooms or were busy making
money, the indentured brethren of this place, the moment they
happened to hear that a strike was on in Charlestown and elsewhere
about the £3 tax, struck work too. They looked for no leaders. The
leaders at Verulam, Tongaat and Isipingo were busy going round
1

Brief reports in The Transvaal Leader and The Star, both of 13-7-1914, said:
“Mr. Gandhi made an importand statement to the effect that Indian disabilities were
only partially satisfied by the Relief Bill, and added that the question of equal status
was bound to come up in the future. He was leaving South Africa for some years, but
might return.”
2
Gandhiji addressed a farewell meeting of about 5,000 indentured and other
Indians. Some representative Europeans also attended. Addresses and purses were
presented to him on behalf of Tamils and other Indians from Verulam and Tongaat. E.
H. Langston presided. Gandhiji first spoke in Hindi and then in English. For the
speech in English, vide the following item.

collecting money. But spontaneously, the friends here struck work.
This proves that poverty is real wealth. The poor are like kings. They
will have their way. Be it here or in India or anywhere else, our
salvation lies through poverty. The poor are the soul of a great
movement like this.
As I accept the addresses that you have presented to me, I
remember an injunction in the scriptures: “Man! Flee from a place
where you find yourself being praised, or at least plug your ears with
cotton-wool.” I keep turning over this injunction in my mind
whenever I hear myself praised. But, on this occasion, I have not been
able to act as enjoined. When one can do neither, the injunction says:
“ Jiva 1 , if you cannot act as enjoined here, offer all the praise you
receive to Lord Krishna.” And this is what I do. Obedience to such
religious injunctions and the path of uprightness will ensure success in
every undertaking. What I mean to say is that you are not right when
you attribute our success to me. It was the strength of our indentured
brothers that brought us success. It is they who have done something
really great. Even if I and those near me had continued to be in gaol
to this day, a settlement would not have come about as quickly as it
did.
[Having explained that the tax, including the arrears, would not be collected
henceforth, Gandhiji said:]

The prevalent impression that because of the repeal of the tax
Indians would have to remain permanently under indenture or be
repatriated is entirely mistaken. On the expiry of your contract, you
can stay as free citizens. My own advice to you is that you should
never re-indenture yourselves. You will, of course, have to complete
the term of the present contract; no one can escape that. Those who
become free can obtain passes from the Protector at Durban. Free
Indians who remain here for three years will be treated as domiciled
here. After completing three years, anyone who wands to go to India
and return will be able to do so. Such a person should go to India at
his own expense, and not approach the Government for the purpose.
But those who have made up their minds not to return here will be
able to claim from the Government the expenses for the journey to
India.
I take this occasion of my visit to Victoria County to offer
thanks to Mr. Marshall Campbell for help in securing the repeal of the

tax. He worked indefatigably in the Senate to achieve that end,
unmindful of his own interests.
Your feeling unhappy, as you say, at my going away binds me
all the firmer to you in love. But I am leaving Phoenix behind me.
You may approach Mr. West or the other inmates on any matter connected with the law or when you are up against any other difficulty.
They will encourage you, advise you and work for you. They will not
charge you a single penny and, in case they can be of no help, they
will direct you to the right quarters. If ever they start demanding
money from you at Phoenix, you should refuse even to turn your
eyes in that direction again. I shall, of course, continue to work for
you. You are under indenture with one person for five years, but I am
under indenture with 300 millions for a life-time. I shall go on with
that service and never displace you from my heart. All the money I
have received here, I shall use for local purposes and the books for
my own study.
It made me very unhappy to know that, during the recent strike,
provoked no doubt by excessive cruelty or some other cause, you
raised your hand in retaliation. Had I been with you, I would have had
my head broken rather than allowed you to do what you did. For the
future, however, I wish to put before you one importand suggestion. If
it should ever happen that the Government is harsh with you or that
your employers ill-treat you, you should fearlessly strike work; sit
yourselves down at one place, go hungry if they do not give you food,
suffer yourselves to be abused and kicked and finally, if such be your
lot, submit even to hanging or being shot dead, but do not waver in
your faith in God. If you act thus, even the stoniest heart will melt.
Such is the power of satyagraha. Have trust in it. This alone is pure
satyagraha. It is a weapon which surpasses all weapons, all your clubs
and other weapons. Cling to it—therefore; it will never fail you in
times of need. Good-bye to you.

198. SPEECH AT VERULAM1
July 12, 1914
Mr. Gandhi asked the chairman’s permission to speak in Hindustani first, and,
then, in as brief as possible English, so that it might be interpreted into Tamil,
which he did not speak. . . . He would not elaborate his Hindi remarks regarding the
presentations and praise to himself. The money would be used for such public
purposes as commanded themselves to him on reaching India, but preference would be
given to South Africa. He then continued:

Please understand, my indentured countrymen, that it is wrong
for you to consider that relief has been obtained because I or youhave
gone to gaol, but because you had the courage to give up your life
and sacrifice yourselves, and, in this instance, I have also to tell you
that many causes led to this result. I have to specially refer to the
valuable assistance-rendered by the Hon. Senator Marshall Campbell.
I think that our thanks and my thanks are due to him for his work in,
the Senate while the Bill was passing through it. The relief is of this
nature: The £3 tax you will not have to pay, and arrears will be
remitted. It does not mean that you are free from your present
indentures. You are bound to go through your present indentures
faithfully and honestly, but when these finish, you are just as free as
any other free Indian under Act 25, 1891, and can receive the same
protection as set forth in that Act. You are not bound to re-indenture
or return to India. Discharge certificates will be issued to you free of
charge. If you wand to go to India and return therefrom, you must
first spend three years in Natal as free Indians. If you, being poor,
wand assistance to enable you to go to India, you can get it on
application to the Government; but, in that case, you would not be
allowed to return. If you wand to return fight shy of this assistance,
and use your own money or borrow from your friends. If you
re-indenture, you come under the same law —namely, 25 of 1891.
My advice to you is: Do not re-indenture, but by all means serve your
present masters under the common law of the county. Now, in the
event of any occasion arising (which I hope it will not do), you will
know what is necessary.
Victoria County has not been as free from violence as the
Newcastle district was. You retaliated. I do not care whether it was
1

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

under provocation or not, but you retaliated, and have used sticks and
stones, and you have burnt sugarcane. That is not passive resistance. If
I had been in your midst I would have repudiated you, and allowed
rather my own head to be broken than allow a single stick or stone to
be used. Passive resistance is a more powerful weapon than all the
sticks, stones and gunpowder in the world. If imposed upon, you must
suffer even unto death. That is passive resistance. If, therefore, I was
an indentured Indian working for the Hon. Mr. Marshall Campbell,
Mr. Saunders, or other employer, and if I found my treatment not just,
I would not go to the Protector—I would go to my master and ask for
justice; and if he would not grand it, I would say that I would
remain there without food or drink until it was granded. I am quite
sure that the stoniest heart will be melted by passive resistance. Let this
sink deeply into yourselves. This is a sovereign and most effective
remedy.
If you wand any advice or guidance, all I can suggest is that you
go to Phoenix to Mr. West [or Mr. Chhaganlal Gandhi]1 , if you do not
wand to pay Mr. Langston, or any of his brothers in law. I have no
doubt that if you go to Mr. Langston with a certificate from Mr. West
[or Mr. Chhaganlal Gandhi], saying that you are too poor to pay a
lawyer’s fee, that the lawyer in Mr. Langston will sleep, and the man
within him will rise, and he will give you advice free of charge. Do not
sign any document unless you first consult Phoenix, and Phoenix
advises you to sign it. If Phoenix ever fails you, or wands a penny
from you, shun Phoenix.
I shall now say my farewell to Verulam and you all. The scene
before me will not fade in my memory, be the distance ever so great.
May God help you all in your trouble. May your own conduct be
such that God may find it possible to help you.
Mr. Gandhi then lowered his voice to address the Europeans near to him. He
asked his European friends to forgive those Indians who during that awful time
retaliated. He had no part or parcel in such retaliation but there were times in life when
one lost self-control, and the brute in one arose, and one felt that might was right,
and worked with the doctrine of “an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth”. He again
asked for their forgiveness. He thought that sometimes the European employer
was inclined to be selfish, and he asked them to bear in mind that the indentured
Indians were human beings, with the same sentiments as themselves. They were not
cattle, but had all the weaknesses of themselves, and all the virtues if they were only
1

brought out. He made a plea for sanitary housing, and asked that the Europeans would
look upon their indentured Indians as fellow-beings, and not as Asiatics who had
nothing in common with them. The indentured Indian was a moral being.

Do not place him in surroundings in which he cannot rise from
hideous immorality. He is not beyond reclaiming, but is capable of
responding to every moral pressure and realising the highest moral
height.1
Let them credit them to the fullest extent with their weaknesses, as also at
least with the possibility of all the virtues. Would they not then treat their Indian
employees even as brothers? It was not enough that they were well treated as they
well treated their cattle. It was not enough that they looked upon them with a kindly
eye merely; but it was necessary that employers should have a much broader view of
their own position, that they should think of their employees as fellow human beings
and not as Asiatics who had nothing in common with them who were Europeans, and
they would also respond to every attention that might be given to them. Then they
would have an intelligent interest not merely in the material or physical well-being
of their men, but in their moral well-being. They would look after their morality, after
their children, after their education, after their sanitation, and, if they were herding
together in such a manner that they could not but indulge in hideous immorality, that
they would themselves recoil with horror from the very imagination that the men who
were for the time being under their control should indulge in these things because
they had been placed in these surroundings. Let them not consider that, because these
men were drawn from the lowest strata of society, they were beyond reclamation. No,
they would respond to every moral pressure that might be brought to bear upon them,
and they will certainly realise the moral height that is possible for every human
being, no matter who he is, no matter what tinge of colour his skin possesses.2

199. SPEECH AT DURBAN MEETING1
[July 12, 1914]
SISTERS AND BROTHERS,

The honour I have received today is the highest ever in my life,
for your love has been simply beyond words, and seeing so many of
my indentured brothers and sisters makes me happy indeed. You must
have heard quite a few things about the Settlement, some of them,
perhaps, false. The indentured friends will be able, on the expiry of
their contracts, to buy land and settle down as free men. If, however,
you are not sufficiently vigiland after my departure or if you weaken,
the Government may even exploit the situation to its advandage. In
that case, all that you did last year to win relief from your sufferings
you must repeat and suffer again. You will not for that purpose need
my presence or that of other leaders. If thus, in the hour of your
difficulty, you turn to satyagraha instead of looking for leaders,
success will assuredly be yours.
I shall now tell you something else. For Indians born here, this
istheir motherland. They have a better right here than other Indians.
Their future is bound up with that of this country. I would ask them to
be vigiland. They would do well to turn their attention to land
insteadof crowding lawyers’ or other offices. Besides, whenever as a
commu-nity you find it necessary to oppose the authorities, you
should employ the same weapon as you did during the last eight years
to a successful end.
Brothers and sisters under indenture, yours is a very wretched
state. I have had information from several sources throwing doubt on
the value of the repeal of the £3 tax. The money thus saved [it has
been suggested] will go to wine-dealers and goldsmiths. The labourers
will be robbed at either place. This is quite true. To goldsmiths, of
course, I can say: “Dear friends, give up robbing. It can have no good
result. Do not reduce your brethren to a miserable state. Do not rob
your poor kith and kin by mixing copper or brass with gold.”
To the wine-dealers, I can say nothing. But I shall address myself to
you. If you resolve that you will have no intoxicating drink, the
wine-dealers will close down their shops. I have often seen numbers

227

of men and women, lost in drink, engaged in street-brawls or going
tipsily along public roads. I have been deeply moved by such sights.
What a pity, I would say, that my brothers and sisters should be in
such a state! Through this wretched habit of drinking, how low have
we sunk in this country? Losing all sense, we have fallen into
immorality and vice. In order that we may be freed from this
condition, the young among us must come forward. They must reason
and plead with the obtuse, entreat them and dissuade them from
drinking. They must station themselves near wine-shops and turn
away Indians who might approach these. If, in doing so, they have to
suffer insults or assaults, they must put up with them, too. This course,
if adopted, would help destroy the evil habit. You will all become
better in the result. The whites here will also look on you with respect.
Your pecuniary condition will improve as well, and you will be set on
the right path. I, therefore, beg of you to shake off this evil habit.
I will never forget your love for me and it will be my chief duty
in India to look after your interests. I am under indenture with you all
for the rest of my life, so that I am not likely ever to put you out of
my heart. May you, too, not forget me.

Whether you are Hindus or Muslims, Parsis or Christians, work
unitedly as Indians. Forget religious differences and never allow your
heart to shrink. The community will retain the prestige it has gained
only if all of you work together. If, during my stay in South Africa, I
have harmed anyone, maybe unknowingly, please forgive me.

201. SPEECH AT JOHANNESBURG1
[July 13, 1914]
Mr. Gandhi . . . declared that at last a settlement had been reached that was
honourable to both sides, and in keeping with the dignity of passive resisters; for the
Government had conceded every tittle of what had been asked for by Mr. Cachalia in
his last letter 2 before the negotiations were interrupted last year. To have asked the
Government to go further would, Mr. Gandhi declared, have been a breach of faith on
the part of passive resisters, to which he could be no party.

202. SPEECH AT FAREWELL BANQUET3
JOHANNESBURG ,

July 14, 1914
Mr. Gandhi said that they or circumstances had placed him that evening in a
most embarrassing position. Hitherto those who had known him in Johannesburg
had known him in the capacity of one of many hosts at gatherings of that kind, but
that evening they had placed him in the unfortunate position of being a guest, and he
did not know how he would be able to discharge that duty. For the other he thought
long experience had fitted him, if he might say so with due humility, most admirably;
but the present position was entirely new to him and Mrs. Gandhi, and he was
exceedingly diffident as to how he was going to discharge the new duty that had been
imposed upon him. So much had been said about Mrs. Gandhi and himself, their
so-called devotion, their so-called self-sacrifice, and many other things. There was
one injunction of his religion, and he thought it was true of all religions, and that was
that, when one’s praises were sung, one should fly from those praises, and, if one
could not do that, one should stop one’s ears, and if one could not do either of these
things, one should dedicate everything that was said in connection with one to the

A farewell banquet was given in the Masonic Hall, Jeppe Street, in honour
of Gandhiji, Kasturba and Kallenbach. They were presented with addresses on behalf
of the British Indian Association, the Chinese Association, the Tamil Benefit
Society, the Transvaal Indian Women’s Association and the Gujarati, the Mahomedan
and the Parsee communities. Offering his four sons to Gandhiji, C. K. T. Naidoo said:
“On behalf of myself and my wife, I have the honour to present these four boys to be
servands of India.”

VOL. 14: 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

Almighty, the Divine Essence, which pervaded everyone and everything in the
Universe, and he hoped that Mrs Gandhi and he would have the strength to dedicate all
that had been said that evening to that Divine Essence.
Of all the precious a gifts that had been given to them, those four boys were
the most precious, and probably Mr. Chamney could tell them something of the law
of adoption in India and what Mr. and Mrs. Naidoo, both of them old gaol-birds, had
done. They had gone through the ceremony of adoption, and they had surrendered
their right to their four children and given them (Mr. and Mrs. Gandhi) the charge. He
did not know that they were worthy to take charge of those children. He could only
assure them that they would try to do their best. The four boys had been his pupils
when he had been conducting a school for Passive Resisters at Tolstoy Farm and later
on at Phoenix. Then when Mrs. Naidoo had sought imprisonment, the boys had been
taken over to Johannesburg, and he thought that he had lost those four pearls, but the
pearls had returned to him. He only hoped that Mrs. Gandhi and he would be able to
take charge of the precious gift.
Johannesburg was not a new place to him. He saw many friendly faces there,
many who had worked with him in many struggles in Johannesburg. He had gone
through much in life. A great deal of depression and sorrow had been his lot, but he
had also learnt during all those years to love Johannesburg even though it was a
Mining Camp. It was in Johannesburg that he had found his most precious friends. It
was in Johannesburg that the foundation for the great struggle of Passive Resistance
was laid in the September of 1906. It was in Johannesburg that he had found a friend,
a guide, and a biographer in the late Mr. Doke. It was in Johannesburg that he had
found in Mrs. Doke, a loving sister, who had nursed him back to life when he had
been assaulted by a countryman who had misunderstood his mission and who
misunderstood what he had done. It was in Johannesburg that he had found a Kallenbach, a Polak, a Miss Schlesin, and many another who had always helped him, and
had always cheered him and his countrymen. Johannesburg, therefore, had the holiest
associations of all the holy associations that Mrs. Gandhi and he would carry back to
India, and, as he had already said on many another platform, South Africa, next to
India, would be the holiest land to him and to Mrs. Gandhi and to his children, for, in
spite of all the bitternesses them those life-long companions. It was in Johannesburg again that the European Committee had been formed, when Indians were going
through the darkest stage in their history, presided over then, as it still was, by Mr.
Hosken. It was last, but not least, Johannesburg that had given Valiamma, that young
girl, whose picture rose before him even as he spoke, who had died in the cause of
truth. Simple-minded in faith—she had not the knowledge that he had, she did not
know what Passive Resistance was, she did not know what it was the community
would gain, but she was simply taken up with unbounded enthusiasm for her people—
she went to gaol, came out of it a wreck, and within a few days died. It was Johannes-

230

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

burg again that produced a Nagappen and Narayansamy, two lovely youths hardly out
of their teens, who also died. But both Mrs. Gandhi and he stood living before them.
He and Mrs. Gandhi had worked in the lime-light; those others had worked behind the
scenes, not knowing where they were going, except this, that what they were doing
was right and proper, and, if any praise was due anywhere at all, it was due to those
three who died. They had had the name of Hurbatsingh given to them. He (the speaker)
had had the privilege of serving imprisonment with him. Hurbatsingh was 75 years
old. He was an ex-indentured Indian, and when he (the speaker) asked him why he had
come there, that he had gone there to seek his grave, the brave man replied, “What
does it matter? I know what you are fighting for. You have not to pay the £3 tax, but
my fellow ex-indentured Indians have to pay that tax and what more glorious death
could I meet?” He had met that death in the gaol at Durban. No wonder if Passive
Resistance had fired and quickened the conscience of South Africa! And, therefore,
whenever he had spoken, he had said that, if the Indian community had gained
anything through this settlement, it was certainly due to Passive Resistance; but it
was certainly not due to Passive Resistance alone. He thought that the cablegram that
had been read that evening showed that they had to thank that noble Viceroy, Lord
Hardinge, for his great effort. He thought, too, that they had to thank the Imperial
Government, who, during the past few years, in season and out of season, had been
sending despatches after despatches to General Botha, and asking him to consider
their standpoint—the Imperial standpoint. They had to thank also the Union
Government for the spirit of justice they had adopted at that time. They had, too, to
thank the noble members of both Houses of the Legislature who had made those
historic speeches and brought about the settlement; and, lastly, they had to thank the
Opposition also for their co-operation with the Government in bringing about the
passage of the Bill, in spite of the jarring note produced by the Natal Members. When
one considered all these things, the service that he and Mrs. Gandhi might have
rendered could be only very little. They were but two out of many instruments that had
gone to make this settlement. And what was that settlement? In his humble opinion,
the value of the settlement, if they were to examine it, would consist not in the
intrinsic things they had received, but in the sufferings and the sorrows long-drawnout that were necessary in order to achieve those things. If an outsider were to come
there and find that there was a banquet given to two humble individuals for the humble
part they played in a settlement which freed indentured Indians from a tax which they
should never have been called upon to pay, and if he were told also that some redress
were given in connection with their marriages, and that their wives who were lawfuly
married to them according to their own religions had not hitherto been recognized as
their wives, but by this settlement those wives were recognized as valid wives
according to the law of South Africa, that outsider would laugh, and consider that
those Indians, or those Europeans who had joined them in having a banquet, and
VOL. 14: 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

231

giving all those praises and; so on, must be a parcel of fools. What was there to gloat
over in having an intolerable burden removed which might have been removed years
ago? What was there in a lawful wife’s being recognized in a place like South Africa?
But, proceeded Mr. Gandhi, he concurred with Mr. Duncan in an article he wrote some
years ago, when he truly analysed the struggle, and said that behind that struggle for
concrete rights lay the great spirit which asked for an abstract principle, and the fight
which was undertaken in 1906, although it was a fight against a particular law, was a
fight undertaken in order to combat the spirit that was seen about to overshadow the
whole of South Africa, and to undermine the glorious British Constitution, of which
the Chairman had spoken so loftily that evening, and about which he (the speaker)
shared his views. It was his knowledge, right or wrong, of the British Constitution
which bound him to the Empire. Tear that Constitution to shreds and his loyalty also
would be torn to shreds. Keep that Constitution intact, and they held him bound a
slave to that Constitution. He had felt that the choice lay for himself and his
fellow-countrymen between two courses, when this spirit was brooding over South
Africa, either to sunder themselves from the British Constitution, or to fight in order
that the ideals of that Constitution might be preserved—but only the ideals. Lord
Ampthill had said, in a preface1 to Mr. Doke’s book, that the theory of the British
Constitution must be preserved at any cost if the British Empire was to be saved from
the mistakes that all the previous Empires had made. Practice might bend to the
temporary aberration through which local circumstances might compel them to pass,
it might bend before unreasoning or unreasonable prejudice, but theory once
recognized could never be departed from, and this principle must be maintained at any
cost. And it was that spirit which had been acknowledged now by the Union
Government, and acknowledged how nobly and loftily. The words that General Smuts
so often emphasised still rang in his ears. He had said, “Gandhi, this time we wand no
misunderstanding, we wand no mental or other reservations, let all the cards be on the
table, and I wand you to tell me wherever you think that a particular passage or word
does not read in accordance with your own reading,” and it was so. That was the spirit
in which he approached the negotiations. When he remembered General Smuts of a
few years ago, when he told Lord Crewe that South Africa would not depart from its
policy of racial distinction, that it was bound to retain that distinction, and that,
therefore, the sting that lay in this Immigration Law would not be removed, many a
friend, including Lord Ampthill, asked whether they could not for the time being
suspend their activity. He had said “No.” If they did that, it would undermine his
loyalty, and even though he might be the only person, he would still fight on. Lord
Ampthill had congratulated him, and that great nobleman had never deserted the cause
1

South Africa”, 26-8-1909.

232

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

even when it was at its lowest ebb, and they saw the result that day. They had not by
any means to congratulate themselves on a victory gained. There was no question of a
victory gained, but the question of the establishment of the principle that, so far as
the Union of South Africa at least was concerned, its legislation would never contain
the racial taint, would never contain the colour disability. The practice would
certainly be different. There was the Immigration Law—it recognized no racial
distinctions, but in practice they had arranged, they had given a promise, that there
should be no undue influx from India as to immigration. That was a concession to
present prejudice. Whether it was right or wrong was not for him to discuss then. But
it was the establishment of that principle which had made the struggle so importand
in the British Empire, and the establishment of that principle which had made those
sufferings perfectly justifiable and perfectly honourable, and he thought that, when
they considered the struggles from that standpoint, it was a perfectly dignified thing
for any gathering to congratulate itself upon such a vindication of the principles of
the British Constitution. One word of caution he wished to utter regarding the
Settlement. The Settlement was honourable to both parties. He did not think there
was any room left for misunderstanding, but whilst it was final in the sense that it
closed the great struggle, it was not final in the sense that it gave to Indians all that
they were entitled to. There was still the Gold Law which had many a sting in it. There
was still the Licensing Law throughout the Union, which also contained many a
sting. There was still a matter which the Colonial-born Indians especially could not
understand or appreciate, namely, the watertight compartments in which they had to
live; whilst there was absolutely free inter-communication and inter-migration
between the Provinces for Europeans, Indians had to be cooped up in their respective
Provinces. Then there was undue restraint on their trading activity. There was the
prohibition as to holding landed property in the Transvaal, which was degrading, and
all these things took Indians into all kinds of undesirable channels. These
restrictions would have to be removed. But for that, he thought, sufficient patience
would have to be exercised. Time was now at their disposal, and how wonderfully the
tone had been changed! And here he had been told in Cape Town, and he believed it
implicitly, the spirit of Mr. Andrews had pervaded all those statesmen and leading
men whom he saw. He came and went away after a brief period, but he certainly fired
those whom he saw with a sense of their duty to the Empire of which they were
members. But, in any case, to whatever circumstances that healthy tone was due, it
had not escaped him. He had seen it amongst European friends whom he met at Cape
Town; he had seen it more fully in Durban, and this time it had been his privilege to
meet many Europeans who were perfect strangers even on board the train, who had
come smilingly forward to congratulate him on what they had called a great victory.
Everywhere he had noticed that healthy tone. He asked European friends to continue
that activity, either through the European Committee or through other channels, and
VOL. 14: 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

233

to give his fellow-countrymen their help and extend that fellow-feeling to them also,
so that they might be able to work out their own salvation.
To his countrymen he would say that they should wait and nurse the
Settlement, which he considered was all that they could possibly and reasonably have
expected, and that they would now live to see, with the co-operation of their European
friends, that what was promised was fulfilled, that the administration of the existing
laws was just, and that vested rights were respected in the administration; that after
they had nursed these things, if they cultivated European public opinion, making it
possible for the Government of the day to grand a restoration of the other rights of
which they had been deprived, he did not think that there need be any fear about the
future. He thought that, with mutual co-operation, with mutual goodwill, with due
response on the part of either party, the Indian community need never be a source of
weakness to that Government or to any Government. On the contrary, he had full
faith in his countrymen that, if they were well treated, they would always rise to the
occasion and help the Government of the day. If they had insisted on their rights on
many an occasion, he hoped that the European friends who were there would remember
that they had also discharged the responsibilities which had faced them.
And now it was time for him to close his remarks and say a few words of
farewell only. He did not know how he could express those words. The best years of
his life had been passed in South Africa. India, as his distinguished countryman, Mr.
Gokhale, had reminded him; had become a strange land to him. South Africa he knew,
but not India. He did not know what impelled him to go to India, but he did know that
the parting from them all, the parting from the European friends who had helped him
through thick and thin, was a heavy blow, and one he was least able to bear; yet
heknew he had to part from them. He could only say farewell and ask them to give him
their blessing, to pray for them that their heads might not be turned by the praise
they had received, that they might still know how to do their duty to the best of their
ability, that they might still learn that first, second, and last should be the
approbation of their own conscience, and that, then, whatever might be due to them
would follow in its own time.1

203. INTERVIEW TO “THE TRANSVAAL LEADER”
[JOHANNESBURG ,

July 14, 1914]
I am going to India for good. I am going with the intention of
never returning, and if ever I have to return to South Africa or leave
India, it will be owing to circumstances beyond my control, and at
present beyond my conception.
The Settlement I consider to be entirely honourable to both
parties. I believe both General Botha and General Smuts have acted
most justly. There has been no mental reservation whatever. The one
desire on the part of General Smuts was that there should be no
misunderstanding left, and he endeavoured to appreciate the Indian
standpoint at every stage of the interviews that he gladly gave me, even
when he was pressed with work.
And I do feel that nothing could have been finer than the
co-operation that the Opposition gave whole-heartedly.
In fact, the whole spirit of the debate, both in the Senate and the
Assembly, in spite of a jarring note from Natal, was of a highly
Imperial order. And it will be a thousand pities if either my own
countrymen, by excessive agitation, or Europeans spoil that tone and
destroy the good effect produced by the Settlement. It respects all the
reasonable demands of the Europeans with reference to immigration
and such other matters, and it concedes to the Indians entirely what
they have been fighting for and suffering for during the last eight
years. Throughout my travelling I have noticed a very exemplary
attitude on the part of European friends, many of whom have been
really strangers to the question, and certainly strangers to me
personally.
[REPORTER: ] Is the struggle really at an end—will Indians here not fight,
constitutionally no doubt, for political equality?

We have never asked for political equality. We do not hope to
get that.
You wand the vote?

No; my view on that would be to leave the question of the
political vote severely alone, and my firm conviction is that passive
resistance is infinitely superior to the vote. I have never asked for the
VOL. 14: 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

235

vote. What I always have insisted on was the removal of racial
distinctions, not for equality.
Mr. Gandhi then went on to recall some of the more remarkable incidents in
his career, particularly the march of the Indian strikers into the Transvaal in November last year which he described as his most wonderful experience in South Africa.

Through that march, I learned to love human nature more, and
to appreciate that no matter whether the human spirit flourished under
European or Indian, under the Western or the Eastern sky, it could
respond in an equal measure to the same chord.
In recounting his experiences on the march, Mr. Gandhi did not dwell on the
hardships; these he seemed to have forgotten. But he recalled the little acts of kindness that were done by obscure individuals. There was the station master who brought
him a glass of milk and a couple of boiled eggs, and many other delicacies to tempt a
starving man.

It seemed rank ingratitude to refuse them, but I kept to my vow,
and I explained to the station master that I seldom ate eggs, and could
not taste the milk and the other nice things he had brought, because I
had to accept the same treatment as the rank and file. He seemed hurt,:
and I was sorry, but I was not ungrateful, and I hope the kind soul
understood.
At another place the proprietor of an hotel said to me: “You are
shivering. Come to my hotel, and I will put you up.” I thanked him,
but declined, and, pointing to my companions, I said: “They too feel
the cold, and are shivering.” “Oh! It is not a case of putting you on
the verandah,” he said, “I will give you a room.” His kind offer I was
obliged to decline.
At another place we reached, a woman who ran a small store
placed everything she had at our disposal. I remonstrated, but she
would have her way. She said: “Though you are all Indians, you are
suffering and I hope I have enough of the old British sense of
sympathy left in me to help you.” At Charlestown and Newcastle the
whole community helped us, and we helped them. There was no
pilfering, no drunkenness.
I explained to the men before they started that they would
win,not by putting their sticks over the shoulders of others, but over
their own. It took them some time to see it, but that was the condition
on which I allowed them to come with me. So our army kept on its
way. We rose before the sun in the morning and did the best of our
day’s march before food passed our lips. Then we halted for a small
236

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

ration of bread and sugar. It was, you will admit, a wonderful thing for
two thousand men to have marched so far without violating the law,
without stealing or rioting.
As to the treatment of himself personally, and of his family during those
troubled times, Mr. Gandhi could not find words to express his appreciation.1

The Transvaal Leader, 15-7-1914

204. LETTER TO INDIANS IN SOUTH AFRICA
[JOHANNESBURG ,

Before July 15, 1914]
DEAR BROTHER OR SISTER,

On the eve of my departure from South Africa, I should like to
leave a brief message in writing.
There has been no limit to the love I have received from the
Indians in this country. I am sure those who have given such love will
always prosper. I hear it said that our community is ungrateful. My
heart tells me that this is said in ignorance and impatience. Were the
Indian people really so, I would have felt no pride in being called a
son of India, nor could I recite with utter sincerity the sublime poem,
India, a refuge of all those that suffer.
Though I have had more than human love from Indians, I also
know that there are some of them who believe themselves, and
aretaken by others, to be my enemies. For me, however, they are no
enemies. Those who speak ill of us sometimes prove to be our true
friends. I do not consider at the moment whether this is so in my case
1

In the course of his report, the representative of The Transvaal Leader
summed up thus his own estimate of Gandhiji: “So it is humanly certain that the most
arresting figure in the Indian community in South Africa today is to say good-bye to a
country in which he has spent many years, crowded with experience and exertion, his
work on behalf of his countrymen at last crowned with success. When a man has been
imprisoned so often that were his offences not merely political he would have
qualified as an ‘habitual’, when he has times without number endured fatigue, and
fasted with a smile, when he has moved steadily on over obstacles that might daunt
the bravest, to the goal on which his eye has been fixed, you might picture him
physically as an Apollo, and imagine his heart made of the fibre that belongs to
martyrs. In the qualities of the heart and of the soul you may believe the best of
Gandhi, but you would wonder, did you see him, that so frail a figure could house so
vigorous a character.”
VOL. 14: 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

or not. I only wand to show that I am not free from responsibility for
their speaking ill of me. If I had perfect love for them, they would
never have bitter things to say against me. Such love, however, is
hardly possible for man. Whilst I lack it, I shall bear their hostility; I
shall not regard them as my enemies.
There are easy and effective measures which will enable Indians
to live in peace in this country. All religious andagonism, as that one
is a Hindu or a Muslim, a Christian or a Parsi, should be forgotten. Let
there be no provincial distinctions such as Bengalis, Madrasis, Gujaratis, Punjabis, etc. All ideas of high and low which divide men into
Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras should be abandoned.
Indians are all subject to the same laws; if so, how can we fight them
disunited?
We need must observe truth. I know it is futile to expect, in this
land, that everyone will be perfectly truthful; it should, however, be
possible for us to adhere to truth, by and large. Otherwise, Indians
cannot live on here as Indians, or human beings.
Whenever there are hardships, they will have to be fought
courageously. Should Indians refuse to fight them, blinded by selfinterest or because of weakness, they will assuredly be overwhelmed
by disaster.
If the leaders are selfish, greedy, lazy, given to lying and
licentious, the common people will make no progress. And so, should
the latter remain backward, the responsibility will be that of the leaders
and theirs, too, will be the guilt.
Indians from Bombay are often rude to those hailing from
Calcutta and Madras and indifferent to their feelings. The term
colcha1 has still not gone out of use in our language. Such ways are
fraught with danger and, if not abandoned, will assuredly bring the
community to grief. The people from Bombay know very well that
their compatriots from Calcutta and Madras are far more numerous
than they. Even from the point of view of self-interest, therefore, it is
necessary that we show them due regard.
Even good Indians show contempt for Colonial-born Indians. I
have believed, and still believe, that they are wrong in doing so. Colonial-born Indians do have some defects; but, then, who has not?
Theyhave also many fine qualities. It is worth noting that, if the
1

238

Probably, a corrupt form of “coolie”
THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

satyagraha campaign has been a glorious performance, it was because
of the sacrifices of Indians born in this country. Large numbers of
such Indians, and many women too, have gone to gaol. To help
forward any Colonial-born Indians, either educated or uneducated,
will be an act of piety on the partof the community meriting a reward,
and I am sure it will be duly rewarded, for such has been my
experience.
We are very dirty and some of us behave so abjectly, because of
greed, that the whites feel disgusted, as they well might. If the leaders
exert themselves, they can end all the filthiness that we notice around
us. That there should be too many people sleeping in small rooms,
that these should hold stores of foodgrains, fruit, etc., and never be
washed, that lavatories should be kept unclean, that bedsteads should
never be aired in the sun, that the windows should never be opened,
that the place should never be dusted, that sleeping, cooking, bathing,
relaxing, should all be done in one and the same room—this is
pathetic indeed. This way we turn ourselves into denizens of hell in
this very world. This state of affairs must change.
Gold-smuggling by members of the community is on the
increase. Some Indians wand to get rich quick. They will get into
trouble and disgrace the name of the community as a whole. I wish
they would rein themselves in.
As some Tamils and Calcuttamen have become slaves to the
wicked habit of drink, so have some Gujaratis too. The Indian who
weans them from this will be a man of noble soul indeed. Indian
businessmen can exercise a good influence, if they mean to, over these
helpless brethren whose state is so pitiable.
As I understand it, the Settlement which has taken place is a
charter of our freedom. We could not have accepted less than what it
gives. More it is not possible to secure at present. It is my emphatic
advice, therefore, that every effort should be made to preserve what
has been obtained and to resist the Government if it seeks to take away
anything from it. If it places upon the terms of the Settlement a
construction different from ours, or mine, or if a court does so and the
Government then refuses to make any modifications, there will be
cause for friction and the Government will again invite the charge of
breach of promise.
The main difficulty for the present will be regarding the
Dealers’ Licenses Act. Even in this matter, however, redress will be
VOL. 14: 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

239

easier wherever things are under the jurisdiction of the Union
Government. Where, on the other hand, licenses are granded by the
municipalities, things will be very difficult. The remedy for this is to
put up a fight whenever licenses are taken away, apply to courts and
petition the Government, hold meetings and pass resolutions. If, at
the end of all this, there should be no redress, there will be nothing
for it but to resort to satyagraha. This is easy to offer in the matter of
licenses. If only the hawkers show courage, the struggle for licences
could be won. It is possible that traders will have to suffer for some
time. I hope they will not fail to do their duty at the critical moment.
We must demand complete freedom to trade, and ought to get it.
Everything depends on the traders.
The Gold Law in the Transvaal is a very oppressive measure.
The settlement secures to all the right to carry on business wherever
they are doing so at present. People can shift their business from one
place to another in the same town, but they cannot go over to another
town. So much can be taken as included in the clause on “existing
rights”. If the Government permits less than this, that will be a breach
of the terms of the Settlement. To secure more than this, independent
efforts will be necessary, and I don’t think these can be made at
present. Great care will have to be exercised to see that they do not
keep us in the dark and pass complicated laws on these and related
subjects. In regard to the Gold Law also, it should be easy to offer
satyagraha against it, if it is administered with excessive severity.
As regards the Transvaal Law of 1885, I don’t see any
possibility of our being able to touch it at present.
On the issue of marriages, it is not possible to secure anything
more for the present. To waste efforts on that will interfere with other
importand tasks. There is no better law elsewhere than the one which
has been enacted.
We need not fight for votes or for freedom of entry for fresh
immigrands from India. I think we shall have to rest content at present
with the removal of the taint [of racial discrimination] from the law.
However, if the Indian community is strong and itself
enterprising, if it maintains unity, truthfulness and courage, the
following expectations may be realized in 15 years:
1. Complete freedom of trade.
2. Full rights of ownership of land in all Provinces and
240

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

3. Freedom of movement from one Province to another.
In order to bring all this about, it will be necessary to have the
Licensing Acts, the Gold Laws, the Township Act, Law 3 of 1885 and
the Immigration Act amended, for which purpose public opinion will
have to be cultivated among the whites of South Africa. This is not
difficult to do.
The community need not be anxious on account of the
indentured labourers. There is nothing in the new law which can be
interpreted to mean that the Government may send them away. I
appeal to all Indians to help Mr. Polak and seek his help. No one is as
well informed about our question as he. He has regard for the
community, is honest, has ability and is full of enthusiasm. It is my
earnest request to Indians in all Provinces that they utilize Mr. Polak’s
services and follow his advice. Others will not be able to draft petitions
as well as he can. He will not accept money for any public work,
which means that he will remain in South Africa only if he can pay his
way by his professional work; otherwise, he will leave for England. I
know that he still does not earn enough to meet his needs and,
therefore, I earnestly appeal to the Transvaal Indians to entrust their
legal affairs to Mr. Polak.
Indian Opinion is run only for the service of the community. So
is Phoenix. Those who have settled there have not done so with the
intention of making money. They draw only as much as they need for
a simple and plain life. It will be so much of a loss to the community
if it does not utilize the services of those who are working in this spirit.
Mr. Omar Hajee Jhaveri and Parsee Rustomjee are now the owners of
the Phoenix lands and its managing trustees in South Africa. The
community can get all information about Phoenix through them or
even directly. I request every Indian to understand the objects of
Phoenix. I cannot help saying that it is a great field for anyone
aspiring to serve India. This, some may indeed feel, is rather improper
of me to say in view of my close association with Phoenix; it is,
however, my sincere belief.
Though I am leaving for the motherland, I am not likely to
forget South Africa. I should like friends who may have occasion to
go to India to come and see me there. I do intend, of course, to work
in India in regard to the disabilities here. And I shall be able to work
better if the people in South Africa ask for my services. I think the
expenses to be incurred in India on this work by way of stationery,
VOL. 14: 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

241

postage, printing, etc., should be met from here. The money I have
been given I propose to use only for this purpose.
Above all, I wish to say that it is up to the community to win its
freedom and that its ultimate weapon, an irresistible one, is satyagraha.
If I have harmed any Indian, knowingly or unknowingly, if I
have been the cause of pain to anyone, I crave God’s forgiveness and
theirs.
I am, of course, a satyagrahi and I hope always to remain one,
but in December last I fell more under the spell of indenture. Since
the term girmitio (“indentured labourer”) is already in use about me
in Gujarati.
I am,
As ever,
The community’s indentured labourer,

205. TRIBUTE TO PASSIVE RESISTANCE MARTYRS1
BRAAMFONTEIN ,

July 15, 1914
Mr. Gandhi said he thought that, in Johannesburg, among their intimate
European friends, Mrs. Phillips was the oldest, and therefore, if they considered her to
be the mother of the family, they only gave her her due. Mrs. Phillips had set the seal
upon that that morning by unveiling those two monuments. He knew that he was
uttering a truism when he said that Mrs. Phillips had taken the trouble, but it was not
the physical trouble. What he wished to refer to was that Mrs. Phillips had come there
with a heart just as sore as any Indian’s and he hoped that the noble words that she had
uttered would go down into the hearts of every one of them. He personally had never
felt tired of repeating his sentiments again and again in connection with that dear
sister—a daughter to her, to him a sister—and that dear brother Nagappen, and
whenever he had thought of those two and the neglected grave of Narayansamy,
whose bones were now resting at Lourenco Marques, he had felt the littleness of the

service rendered by all of them. Mrs. Polak had just reminded him how lightly they
had treated the sickness of the girl whose body lay under that cold stone. He recalled
also a scene when he left Durban, and when he had paid a hurried visit, with Mr. Polak
to see Valliamma—that was a most affecting scene. She was just coming out. Her
mother was there. Her mother, most loving and attentive, thought that she must hurry
forward Valliamma. He felt guilty that there was any hurry at the time, but she was
brought out. She was almost in a swoon. They three carried her in the best manner
they could. There was no feather mattress, no stretcher, in the room where she lay,
simply the wooden floor; not that they were cruel to her, but their discipline was so
rigorous and exacting that those who were in immediate charge, as Thambi Naidoo,
would not think of having any other things or taking any other things. That was her
lot inside and outside prison, that was her spirit, that was the spirit also, he well
remembered, of the young lady by her side in the same condition, who had just been
delivered of a child. He did not know whether they should not now consider
themselves criminally guilty. At the same time he did not know because, as Passive
Resisters, they held the soul immortal, and the body merely subject to the spirit, and
if the body might be lost for the perfection of the soul, they held it was the right
thing. Valliamma herself, he fancied, if he knew anything of that soul, would have
spurned the idea of being treated differently from her other sisters. Those scenes
would never be effaced from his memory. Nagappen’s face he could not recall so
vividly as Valliamma’s, but he knew full well how that brave lad had suffered in that
horrible camp prison, exposed to the most severe weather, and how unnecessary it
had been to send him there. But the desire then had been not to do something for
Passive Resisters but to bend their spirit. But today they recognized the steel of
which Nagappen’s heart was made. He came out of prison a wreck, but he said. What
did it matter? He had to die but once, and he was ready to go to gaol again if it was
necessary for him to do so, and so that undaunted spirit died. But yet they were not
dead, for they would live, and live for ever in the memory of every Indian. It was a
matter for mourning that they were no longer with them to set them a noble example,
but when he thought of it a little more deeply, it was a matter for rejoicing that they
had amongst them such three noble souls who had usefully lived out their lives for the
sake of truth—he would not say for their country. Little they knew of their country.
He believed they were perfect strangers to it—they were Colonial-born. They had no
idea of their Motherland; to them South Africa was their Motherland; but this they
knew, that it was a sacred fight, a religious fight, a fight for truth. They lived for the
truth, and for it they died, and therefore he felt that they had every cause for rejoicing
and instead of appreciating them by stones, they should erect in their own hearts,
every one of them, imperishable memorials, and, whenever they felt like succumbing
to temptation, remind themselves of the imperishable names of these three. Then,
indeed, would they have done honour to their graves in the true spirit and then only
VOL. 14: 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

243

would it have been worth Mrs. Phillips’ while to have come there all the way to
perform that ceremony.

206. SPEECH AT TRANSVAAL INDIAN WOMEN’S
ASSOCIATION1
JOHANNESBURG ,

July 15, 1914
Mr. Gandhi said that they had spoken of him that day as a Protector and a Guru
but he felt that he was undeserving of either title, but if they would accept him as their
devoted brother, it was the highest honour that he could claim from them, and he
knew that it would be a precious privilege to him to think of them, wherever he might
be, as his sisters. And as their co-worker and fellow-Passive Resister, but with greater
experience than they possessed, he could only tell them to continue the work they
had commenced, and that the work they had done was noble. They should hold
together as one woman, and, if the call to duty came again, they should not fail to
respond and should not fail to do even as Valliamma had done. They should not forget
Mrs. Vogl2 . She had done much selfless work. They could still receive her assistance
in taking sewing classes and much other work. Her companionship too was worth
catering for. She was a true woman who felt for them. She would do more if she could,
and she would never fail to do all she could. They owed her a great deal, but the best
honour that they could pay Mrs. Vogl was not to pile gifts upon her, but to follow her
advice and receive her assistance, which she was most anxious to give in connection
with classes and such other matters. In India sisters gave their blessings to their
departing brothers, whether younger or older than they. He hoped that his sisters
there would give him their blessing, no matter in what part of the world he might be
placed.

207. SPEECH AT MUSLIM MEETING1
[VREDEDORP,

July 15, 1914]
Before answering the questions, Mr. Gandhi, who was applauded by a section,
assured them that he appreciated it as a high honour that they had invited him,
because he knew that some of them were opposed to the Settlement and had moved
heaven and earth that the settlement should not become final. He had not despaired of
pleasing even these countrymen of his. The first question was on whose authority he
had accepted or arranged this settlement with the Government. It was on the authority
of the general body of the Indians throughout South Africa, because when the final
letter of Mr. Cachalia was sent, it was sent in the name of the British Indian
community. 2 He was the secretary and carried on the negotiations, and when he found
that there was nothing he had to abandon but that he could get all, he did not consider
it necessary to come to them again 3 . It was not possible for any public man to do
otherwise. If he had done less he would have been an unworthy servand. He did his
duty when he carried out the full terms of that letter. Of course, General Smuts wanded
this Settlement accepted by the community in general —he did not wand to leave any
1
Gandhiji addressed a crowded Muslim meeting at the Hamidia Islamic
Society Hall, convened for the purpose of expressing Muslims’ dissatisfaction over
the Sett-lement. Essop Ismail Mia presided. Gandhiji’s speech largely comprised
statements made in reply to various questions put to him by the Chairman of the
meeting and by other speakers. Rand Daily Mail, 16-7-1914, reported Mia’s
observations as follows: “The Chairman whose remarks were interpreted—
sometimes with the aid of Mr. Gandhi himself—-asked on whose authority the
compromise was made with the Government. He next referred to the funds of the
plague hospital, and wished Mr. Gandhi to say what had become of the funds. Ever
since the commencement the Indian Association had subscribed, and he wished the
accounts to come before the public, and that Mr. Gandhi should explain the position.
Four points had been put forward, and Mr. Gandhi, according to his view, had gained
only one and a half. In the marriage problem a question had cropped up which required
explanation, affecting the Mahommedans. He would explain to his merchand friends
what they had gained during their eight years’ struggle. Mr. Gandhi had said in Durban
that no man could satisfy everybody. He wished to say that Mr. Gandhi had left them
with the battle to be fought all over again. As regards the marriage question, not only
the Mahommedans, but the Hindus also had said that they had gained nothing.”
2
The Transvaal Leader report of the same date has here the words: “. . . without
a word of protest. It was supported by all throughout.”
3
The Transvaal Leader report has: “ . . . he did not think there was any need to
hesitate as to whether he should keep it open or conclude the agreement. He had
abandoned nothing, but gained everything.”

loophole. In the series of meetings so far there had been as much unanimity as
possible. The next question was what had they gained out of the Settlement? He
suggested that they had gained everything they had asked for. They had gained to the
fullest extent and in the most liberal manner.
The next question was what had he done with the hospital moneys? There had
been some misunderstanding about this. The origin of this fund was as follows: The
stands in the old location had been expropriated, and he acted on behalf of certain
claimands against the Town Council.1 He did not charge the full legal fees, which,
taxed, would have amounted to £40 or £50. He agreed to charge so much a stand, and
told them that he did not wand it all for himself. £5 he would use for his own
purposes, and set the balance aside as the nucleus of a hospital fund. He had ideas at
the time of going to England, [of] qualifying as a doctor, 2 and coming out again to
minister to their needs; but those were castles in the air. There were no public funds—
no charity. 3 The whole of that fund had been used up in the course of the passive
resistance movement for public purposes and South African public purposes; but he
was unable to hold himself responsible to the public in connection with those funds;
but even a child could come and look at his public dealings.
With regard to the accounts of the British Indian Association, he had also to
inform them that, every time they had held a committee meeting, he had submitted
accounts of disbursements. Later on he had several funds—the andi-Indian law fund,
the passive resistance fund, and the funds from Bombay. All these he had accounted
for, some in the columns of the Press. He was not taking the books away, and at any
time they could ask Mr. Polak as to the disposal of the funds. So long as they were
not unreasonable, they could certainly inspect what had been done.
The next question was how many points had been gained. The points in Mr.
Cachalia’s letter were the marriage question, the £3 tax, the Orange Free State and the
Cape entry question, and the administration of the existing legislation with due
regard to the Indians’ feelings. They had got these five points, and a little more. Now
what had the merchands gained? The merchands had gained everything that the
community had gained, and had gained probably most of all. The Indian community
had raised its status in the estimation of Europeans throughout South Africa. They
could no longer be classed as coolies by General Botha and others. The term had been
removed as a term ofreproach, silently but effectively. If they had not fought for the
past eight years, no trace would have been left here of Indians as a self-respecting
community. They might have been able to live in the Locations and eke out the
miserable existence of coolies and dogs. If they had asked for more they would not

have got it, and would have been hounded out of court and been regarded as a
community not to be trusted. He explained what they had gained by the Settlement in
regard to marriage,1 and concluded by stating that he would continue to serve the
community. That was his religion.2
1

The Transvaal Leader report here furnishes details of Gandhiji’s reply on this
point: “He had not yet heard a Hindoo say he was not satisfied with the marriage
question. That was where they had gained a little more than they asked. Before the
Port Elizabeth case, they thought one Indian wife would be recognized, no matter
what her religion. That was overturned; and they came to the conclusion that they
should ask the Government to legalise one-wife marriage throughout South Africa.
Polygamy had been a question in this country for 50 years, but the only question
which arose concerning the Settlement was that of monogamous marriages. What
they asked in this respect was granded, and a little more also, for Magistrates were
allowed to legalise marriages. Polygamy they could practise, but it was not legalised.
Natives could only have one wife. Sir William Solomon wanded to go as far as that
with the Indians, but he (Mr. Gandhi) said, ‘No; if you do, we will fight.’ All he
expected the South African Government to do was to become tolerand of polygamy,
but not to legalise it.”
2
Here H. O. Ally, who had in 1909 accompanied Gandhiji on a deputation to
England, raised a number of points, as reported by Rand Daily Mail: “It was only fair
that Mr. Gandhi should call a mass meeting and explain the Settlement. They had
heard one thing from his speeches in Cape Town and another thing from his speeches
in Durban. In his speech at the Masonic Hall again, Mr. Gandhi had admitted that the
Colonial-born question was not settled. Many things were not settled, and yet with
what right or face could any Indian organisations apply to General Smuts in the
future, and say there were certain disabilities and grievances that were killing their
people—in the face of Mr. Gandhi’s expressions here of the ‘final honourable
settlement’?
“Cables and congratulations had passed between Gokhale, the Imperial
Government and India. Where could they ask for more redress? What they wanded him
to explain to them was how they were going to live in future. They had trusted Mr.
Gandhi. He (the speaker) was one of his admirers. He (Mr. Gandhi) knew that it was
his elder brother that was talking to him. It was not one who was jealous of him. Mr.
Gandhi had been a staunch patriot, and he had said so to his detractors. But he (the
speaker) never knew that Mr. Gokhale cabled to Mr. Gandhi that it was a mistake not
to submit to the Commission the real grievances of the Indians throughout the
Transvaal. He now understood that Mr. Gandhi had received such a cable
and had spent about £200 on sending a lengthy cable to Bombay about the oath to
continue passive resistance until the four points were settled. Now about this
settlements. No sensible man expected the Union Government to legalise
polygamous marriages. But Mr. Gandhi ought to know very well, because a message
was sent to him from that Hall, that it was impossible for Mussulmans to break one
syllable out of their holy Koran. He was told that, whatever he did with regard to the
marriage question, not to bind the Mussulmans with regard to one man one wife,
because they would be transgressing the law of God. And the Koran said that
‘Whosoever transgresses the statutes of God will be cast into hell fire for ever.’

Mr. Gandhi, in reply, said that there was no compulsory registration of
children who were South-Africa-born. Up to the age of sixteen they were entirely free.
If all passive resisters had fallen and he was the only one left, he would have died in
that cause. As for the future, he had said that the Settlement was final in the sense that
passive resistance was closed. His own letter 1 to General Smuts had left the door
open. The Settlement was that of the passive resistance on the questions that were on
the board for which they had fought and bled and suffered. It did not close anything
else. It did not prevent them from holding mass meetings, passing resolutions and
taking up new passive resistance. The inter-provincial immigration was an open
question yet. That was not in the terms of the Settlement, and it was a fair matter for
agitation on the part of the Indian community.
The Settlement did not bind himself or the Indian community not to restart
passive resistance if they came to the conclusion that they had grievances which
would justify it. Take the Free State question, the licensing laws, the gold laws, and
the township laws. He had warned his countrymen, however, that they must educate
Europeans on these matters. On the marriage question the Settlement did not violate
one iota of the Holy Koran. He had admitted that they did not expect a Christian
community to legalise polygamy, so that there was no point at issue. Day and night
his programme was so full that he was not allowed time for meals. He was addressing
meetings all the time—some twenty mass meetings in the last few days.2
After a number of speeches in Hindustani, Gujarati and Tamil, Mr. Gandhi
replied. He did not think the letter he had received was representative of Mahomedan
opinion. It was their duty if they wanded a meeting at that time to call it and invite
him. With regard to the £1,200, he pointed out that Indian Opinion was a public
Indian property—it was only nominally registered in his name. The money was

Therefore they could not accept the law and would remain in the country as unmarried.
Not a single Mussulman had accepted the Cape law of 1860. In fairness it was his duty
to call a public meeting before talking of an honourable final Settlement. He
challenged Mr. Gandhi to call a mass meeting and produce the minute books of the
British Indian Association. At the time of the 1909 passive resistance movement Mr.
Gandhi had said that he would continue to resist until all children were free, even if he
were the only person left.”

At this stage, there were further questions put to Gandhiji. According to The
Transvaal Leader report: “Mr. Stent asked how Mr. Gandhi could say he represented
Indian opinion, when the Hamidia Islamic Society and the Hamdad Society passed a
resolution on March 31 saying that he and his friends had no authority to act for
them? He had been deliberately repudiated by the two societies. Mr. Gandhi received
certain funds for the passive resistance movement, and it was up to him to give an
account of them. Habib Motan asked if Mr. Gandhi did not take £1,200 for the
Phoenix newspaper.”

them. Still he told them again that they could go to Mr. Polak and see what had been
done with the money. He eulogised Mr. Polak for his work and self-sacrifice for the
Indian cause. He (Mr. Polak) would be secretary of the British Indian Association. Mr.
Polak had certainly been receiving his living out of the passive resistance fund but he
had contributed his all to that fund.

208. SPEECH AT TAMIL MEETING1
JOHANNESBURG ,

July 15, 1914
Mr. Gandhi said that he felt, in coming to meet the Tamil brothers and sisters,
as if he came to meet blood relations. That was a sentiment which he had cherished
now for many years, and the reason was quite simple. Of all the different sections of
the Indian community, he thought that the Tamils had borne the brunt of the struggle.
The largest number of deaths that passive resistance had taken had been from the
Tamil community. They had that morning gone to the cemetery to perform the
unveiling ceremony 2 in connection with the two memorials to a dear sister and
brother. Both of these had been Tamils. There was Narayansamy whose bones lay at
Delagoa Bay. He had been a Tamil. The deportees had been Tamils. The last to fight
and come out of gaol had been Tamils. Those who were ruined hawkers were all
Tamils. The majority of the passive resisters at Tolstoy Farm had been Tamils. On
every side, Tamils had shown themselves to be most typical of the best traditions of
India, and by saying that he was not exaggerating in the slightest degree. The faith,
the abundand faith in God, in Truth, that the Tamils had shown had been one of the
most sustaining forces throughout those long-drawn years. The majority of women to
go to gaol were Tamils. The sisters who defied the authorities to arrest them and had
gone from door to door, from barracks to barracks at Newcastle, to ask the men to lay
down their tools and strike work—who were they? Again, Tamil sisters. Who
marched among the women? Tamils, of course. Who lived on a pound loaf of bread and
an ounce of sugar? The majority were Tamils; though there he must give their due also
to those of their countrymen who were called Calcutta men. In that last struggle they
also had responded nobly, but he was not able to say quite so nobly as the Tamils; but

was attended by Kasturba, Miss Sehlesin and a number of ladies, Indians and Europeans. Thambi Naidoo presided.

they had certainly come out almost as well as the Tamils had, but the Tamils had
sustained the struggle for the last eight years and had shown of what stuff they were
made from the very beginning. Here in Johannesburg they were a handful, and yet,
even numerically, they would show, he thought the largest number who had gone to
gaol again and again; also, if they wanded imprisonment wholesale, it came from the
Tamils. So that he felt when he came to a Tamil meeting that he came to
blood-relations. The Tamils had shown so much pluck, so much faith, so much
devotion to duty and such noble simplicity, and yet had been so self-effacing. He did
not even speak their language, much as he should like to be able to do so, and yet
they had simply fought on. It had been a glorious, a rich experience, which he would
treasure to the end of his life. How should he explain the settlement to them? They did
not even wand it. But if he must he could only tell them all that they and theirs had
fought for had been obtained and obtained largely through the force of character that
they had shown; and yet they did not wand, they had not wanded to reap the reward
except the reward that their own consciences would offer them. They had fought for
the Cape entry right for Colonial-borns. That they had got. They had fought for the
just administration of the laws. That they had got. They had fought for the removal of
the racial taint in the law with reference to the Free State. That they had got The £3
tax was now a matter of the past. And, with reference to the marriage question, all
those dear sisters who had gone to gaol could now be called the wives of their
husbands, whilst but yesterday they might have been called so out of courtesy by a
friend, but were not so in the eye of the law. That was one of the things they had
fought for and had got. Truth was what they had been fighting for, and Truth had
conquered—not he or they. They might fight tomorrow for an unrighteous thing, and
as sure as fate they would be beaten and well-beaten. Truth was unconquerable, and
whenever the call to duty came, he hoped they would respond. There was one thing
more. They had sometimes, as every other section of the community had, jealousies
amongst themselves. They had petty jealousies not in connection with the struggle,
but in matters which had nothing to do with the struggle. All those petty jealousies
and differences he hoped would go, and they would rise higher still in the estimation
of themselves and of those who at all grew to know them and the depth of character
which they had. They had also, as ail sections of the Indian community had, not only
those jealousies but sometimes many bickerings also, and petty quarrels. He felt
these also should be removed especially from their midst, because they had shown
themselves so fit to give themselves to the Motherland. And here, of course, it was a
Tamil who had given his four sons to be trained as servands of India.1 He hoped Mr.
and Mrs. Naidoo knew exactly what they had done. They had surrendered all right to
those children for life, and they could not possibly do anything to advance their
1

250

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

material well-being, but had always to remain servands of India. It was no joke, and
yet Mr. and Mrs. Naidoo had certainly done that. He could not appeal to them too
strongly that they of all sections should rid themselves of all those bickerings, petty
jealousies and quarrels amongst them-selves. He would also ask them whenever they
chose a President or a Chairman to obey him, to follow him, and not always listen to
the views of this or that man. If they did that, their usefulness would be curtailed. And
then, too, they should not worry if others and not they might reap the reward. Their
reward would be all the greater if it was not of this earth; they were not fighting for
material reward, and a true passive resister never thought of material reward. They
should not worry about material prosperity, but always have higher things before
them. Then, indeed, they would be like the leaven working in the community which
could raise the community as one to look up to. The privilege was certainly theirs and
time also was at their disposal, and if they make good use of that time it would be a
splendid thing for the whole of South Africa, and would certainly be a splendid thing
for them; and if he heard in India that all those little things to which he had drawn
attention had also been got rid of by the Indian community, he would, indeed, be
rejoiced. One thing more. He had known something of Madras, and how sharp caste
distinctions were there. He felt they would have come to South Africa in vain if they
were to carry those caste prejudices with them. The caste system had its uses, but that
was an abuse. If they carried caste distinctions to that fatuous extent and drew those
distinctions, and called one another high and low and so on, those things would be
their ruin. They should remember that they were not high caste or low caste, but all
Indians, all Tamils. He said Tamils, but that was also applicable to the whole Indian
community, but most to them because most was certainly expected of them.1

July 16, 1914
Mr. Gandhi, in replying, said that he was very pleased that Mr. Stent had
consented to preside. Nothing could have been more fitting, on account of the way in
which Mr. Stent had advocated their cause. When the speaker first came to Pretoria he
found comments in the Pretoria News advocating their cause. He inquired, and was told
that Mr. Stent was a negrophilist and took up many an unpopular cause at great

personal risk to himself. Mr. Stent had consistently advocated their cause, and the
speaker felt personally grateful to him. He reciprocated Mr. Chamney’s sentiments.
He had certainly stood up against Mr. Chamney and the management of his office, but
there had been no personal ill will on the speaker’s part, and he always received the
utmost courtesy at Mr. Chamney’s hands. He appreciated the compliment Mr.
Chamney paidhim by coming out to arrest him with one man only to assist, while the
speaker was at the head of 2,000 men and women. It showed the confidence Mr.
Chamney had in him as a passive resister. He thanked them for the purse, the contents
of which, in common with those of any others received, would not be used for
himself, but first for the furtherance of the interests of the Indians in South Africa,
and secondly for any work he might have to do in India which had commended itself
to them in the course of the conversations they had had. He spoke feelingly of the
many European friends he was leaving behind, and said that on their memorable
march he had had much sympathy and encouragement from Europeans; it was for this
reason that that march had made him love South Africa more than ever before. It was
during that. period he had realised that, although South Africa was a land largely ruled
by materialism, there was no need to despair. He felt that the settlement they had
received was a kind of Magna Charta. It was not a final settlement in the sense that
they had no wrongs left. They had to exercise patience and cultivate European
opinion in order to get those wrongs redressed. They had to maintain the sympathy,
which men like. Mr. Stent might think fit to extend to them. He spoke of the
tremendous force of passive resistance, which he hoped they would not need to use
again, and said Indians could not separate politics from religion; with them the two
things were as one. He paid a glowing tribute to the work done for the Indian cause by
Miss Schlesin. 1

other hand, though I can explain my aims best to Gujaratis because I
know Gujarati, they have failed in their duty. They cared [more] for
money. It makes me very unhappy to hear that some members of the
community have fallen a prey to drink. They must be pitied. Those
who know better have a duty to help such persons break free from the
vicious habit. Some are engaged in smuggling gold. They believe that
thereby they are helping India economically. Ill-gotten money,
however, is never secure. I have not yet attained a state in which I
would not seek monetary help. Even so, I would on no account accept
help offered from such ill-gotten money. You will perhaps feel
that,every time I speak to you, I use fairly harsh language. My bitter
words will, however, prove wholesome to you in the end. I am going
far away from you, to the motherland, but I can never forget your
affection.

211. THE LEGAL POSITION
[Before July 18, 1914] 1
As the removal of the £3 tax has given rise to the fear that it
makes the Indians affected by it prohibited immigrands and that,
therefore, their position becomes worse than before, it may be worth
while examining the true legal position. For, if it is a fact that the
removal makes them prohibited immigrands, the first clause of
Paragraph 2 of the letter2 from the Secretary for the Interior addressed
to Mr. Gandhi, providing for the issue of discharge certificates to such
Indians, does not, as The Natal Mercury says, take them out of the
category. That clause was inserted, not for the purpose, as the Mercury
would have us believe, of securing these poor men’s right of domicile.
It was inserted simply to enable the men to move about the Province
without vexatious inquiries from the Police and to free them from
liability of arrest for being without passes. Now the contention that has
been made by the Mercury is that, if the men do not pay the tax, they
1

England en route to India.

VOL. 14: 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

253

have to perform one of the other two conditions of their contract,
namely, to re-indenture or to repatriate themselves to India, and, if
they do not do either—so it is argued—they can be declared
prohibited immigrands in virtue of Section 30 of the Immigrands’
Regulation Act of last year, which defines the term “domicile”,
declaring those who may have entered the Union under terms of
conditional residence prohibited immigrands. If the above contention
were correct, those Indians who have not paid the tax for years could
all have been declared prohibited immigrands and driven out of the
Province immediately after the passing of the Immigrands’ Regulation Act. But no such thing was done. The contracts containing the
conditions as to re-indenture or re-patriation are made with the
Immigration Trust Board, a private body. It is a well-known maxim
oflaw, that contracts which are opposed to public morals or are in
restraint of personal liberty, are invalid. Therefore, the clause as to
repatriation, being against public morals and in restraint of personal
liberty, is invalid, and a special statute would be necessary to make
them valid and effective in law. This is what the late Natal Government
tried and failed to obtain from the Government of India, and the only
thing—though it was a wrong and shameful thing—that the then
Government of India consented to do, was to make the men, who did
not repatriate themselves, liable to pay the tax. Therefore, the tax
being removed, the clause as to repatriation or re-indenture becomes
ineffective and valueless. Another maxim of law is that any Statute
which does not provide a sanction, that is, a penalty, for a breach of
any of the obli-gations which it may impose upon the subject is
powerless to compel the subject to perform that obligation. This was
clearly laid down by the Supreme Court of the Transvaal in a case that
arose out of Law 3 of 1885, which requires Indians to reside in
Locations. If they do not so reside, no penalty is provided in that Law,
and the Supreme Court has, therefore, held that Indians cannot be
compelled to live in Locations, and that position remains unchanged,
and, in spite of the Section referred to, Indians reside where they like
in the Transvaal. It is, therefore, absolutely clear, so far as the legal
aspect is concerned, that the Indians affected by the repeal of the tax
are exactly in the same position as those who came under Law 25 of
1891. Adding to this the fact that the Commission themselves,
composed of three distinguished lawyers, recommended the repeal of
Section 6 of the Act of 1895 in question, and considered the repeal to
be sufficient to put the men who came under it in the same position as
254

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

those who came under Law 25 of 1891, that the Government of India
and the Imperial Government, too, hold the same opinion as the
Commission, and understood clearly that the men, after the repeal of
the tax, would be free to settle in the Province after completing their
present indenture and that the Union Government themselves have
declared that such is also their reading of the law, we fail to see the
slightest cause for alarm. The Mercury further has suggested that,
whilst the assurance of the Union Government may be enough, should
the legal interpretation placed upon it be found to be true, that
assurance will not be of any value if General Hertzog were to become
the Premier. We cannot share this fear, no matter what policy General
Hertzog may have on the Indian question. In a constitution[al] State
such as the Union of South Africa is, General Hertzog would be
bound by the promise made by his predecessor to third parties. He
can change policy, he can alter laws, but he cannot, he dare not, alter
or commit a breach of promise made by predecessors in office to
third parties. If he could, it is easy to see that there would be an end to
government, and that people could not with any assurance have
dealings with governments where there is Responsible Ministry [sic].
Lastly, our countrymen need have no fear as to the future. Many
things are possible; they are highly improbable. It is possible that the
Supreme Court may interpret the law as the Mercury has. It is possible,
though highly improbable, that any future Government or even the
present Government would commit a breach of the promise deliberately made. Surely, in those circumstances, with the clearest conscience and with the fullest justification before the world, Indians can
make use of the same irresistible weapon of Passive Resistance, as they
have hitherto done.

212. FAREWELL LETTER1
[CAPE TOWN ,

July 18, 1914]
I would like, on the eve of my departure for India, to say a few
words to my countrymen in South Africa, and also to the European
community. The kindness with which both European and Indian
friends have overwhelmed me sends me to India a debtor to them. It is
a debt I shall endeavour to repay by rendering in India what services I
am capable of rendering there; and if, in speaking about the South
African Indian question, I am obliged to refer to the injustices which
my countrymen have received and may hereafter receive, I promise
that I shall never wilfully exaggerate, and shall state the truth and
nothing but the truth.
A word about the Settlement, and what it means. In my humble
opinion, it is the Magna Charta of our liberty in this land. I give it the
historic name, not because it gives us rights which we have never
enjoyed and which are in themselves new or striking, but because it
has come to us after eight years’ strenuous suffering, that has involved
the loss of material possessions and of precious lives. I call it our
Magna Charta because it marks a change in the policy of the Government towards us and establishes our right not only to be consulted in
matters affecting us, but to have our reasonable wishes respected. It
moreover confirms the theory of the British Constitution that there
should be no legal racial inequality between different subjects of the
Crown, no matter how much practice may vary according to local
circumstance. Above all, the Settlement may well be called our Magna
Charta, because it has vindicated passive resistance as a lawful, clean
weapon, and has given in passive resistance a new strength to the
community and I consider it an infinitely superior force to that of the
vote, which history shows has often been turned against the voters
themselves.
The Settlement finally disposes of all the points that were the
subject-matter of passive resistance, and in doing so it breathes the
spirit of justice and fair play. If the same spirit guides the

administration of the existing laws, my countrymen will have
comparative peace, and South Africa will hear little of the Indian
problem in an acute form.
Some of my countrymen have protested against it. The number
of these protestants is numerically very small, and in influence not of
great importance. They do not object to what has been granted, but
they object that it is not enough. It is impossible, therefore, to
withhold sympathy from them. I have had an opportunity of speaking
to them, and I have endeavoured to show to them that, if we had asked
for anything more, it would have been a breach of submission made
on behalf of the British Indians in a letter addressed to the Government by Mr. Cachalia during the latter part of last year and we should
have laid ourselves open to the charge of making new demands. But I
have also assured them that the present settlement does not preclude
them from agitation (as has been made clear in my letter to the
Secretary of the Interior of the 16th ultimo) for the removal of other
disabilities which the community will still suffer from under the Gold
Law, the Townships Act, the Law 3 of 1885 of the Transvaal and the
Trade Licences Laws of Natal and the Cape. The promise made by
General Smuts to administer the existing law justly and with due
regard to vested rights gives the community breathing time, but these
laws are in themselves defective, and can be, as they have been, turned
into engines of oppression and instruments by indirect means to drive
the resident Indian population from South Africa. The concession to
popular prejudice in that we have reconciled ourselves to almost the
total prohibition by administrative methods of a fresh influx of Indian
immigrants, and to the deprivation of all political power, is, in my
opinion, the utmost that could be reasonably expected from us. These
two things being assured, I venture to submit that we are entitled to
full rights of trade, inter-Provincial migration, and ownership of
landed property being restored in the not distant future. I leave South
Africa in the hope that the healthy tone that pervades the European
community in South Africa today will continue, and that it will enable
Europeans to recognize the inherent justice of our submission. To my
countrymen I have, at various meetings that I have addressed during
the past fortnight, attended in several cases by thousands, said, “Nurse
the Settlement; see to it that the promises made are being carried out.
Attend to development and progress from within. Zealously remove
all causes which we may have given for the rise and growth of antiVOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

257

Indian prejudice or agitation, and patiently cultivate and inform European opinion so as to enable the Government of the day and
Legislature to restore to us our rights. “ It is by mutual co-operation
and goodwill that the solution of the balance of the pressing
disabilities which were not made points for passive resistance may be
obtained in the natural course, and without trouble or agitation in an
acute form.
The presence of a large indentured and ex-indentured Indian
population in Natal is a grave problem. Compulsory repatriation is a
physical and political impossibility, voluntary repatriation by way of
granting free passages and similar inducements will not—as my
experience teaches me—be availed of to any appreciable extent. The
only real and effective remedy for this great State to adopt is to face
responsibility fairly and squarely, to do away with the remnant of the
system of indenture, and to level up this part of the population and
make use of it for the general welfare of the Union. Men and women
who can effectively strike in large bodies, who can for a common
purpose suffer untold hardships, who can, undisciplined though they
are, be martyrs for days without police supervision and yet avoid
doing any damage to property or person, and who can in times of
need serve their King faithfully and capably, as the ambulance corps
raised at the time of the late war (and which had among other classes
of Indians nearly 1,500 indentured Indians) bore witness, are surely
people who will, if given ordinary opportunities in life, form an
honourable part of any nation.
If any class of persons have special claim to be considered, it is
these indentured Indians and their children, to whom South Africa has
become either a land of adoption or of birth. They did not enter the
Union as ordinary free immigrants, but they came upon invitation
and, indeed, even after much coaxing by agents of South African
employers of this class of labour. In this letter I have endeavoured as
accurately and as fairly as is in my power to set forth the Indian
situation, and the extraordinary courtesy, kindness and sympathy that
have been shown to me during the past month by so many European
friends. The frankness and generosity with which General Smuts, in
interviews that he was pleased to grant me, approached the questions at
issue, and the importance that so many distinguished members of both
Houses of Parliament attached to the Imperial aspect of the problem,
give me ample reason for believing that my countrymen who have
made South Africa their home will receive a fairly full measure of
258

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

justice and will be enabled to remain in the Union with self-respect
and dignity.
Finally, in bidding good-bye to South Africa, I would like to
apologise to so many friends on whom I have not been able, through
extreme pressure of work, to call personally. I once more state that,
though I have received many a hard knock in my long stay in this
country, it has been my good fortune to receive much personal
kindness and consideration from hundreds of European friends,
well-wishers and sympathisers. I have formed the closest friendships,
which will last for ever, for this reason and for many similar reasons,
which I would love to reduce to writing but for fear of trespassing
unduly upon the courtesy of the Press. This sub-continent has become
to me a sacred and dear land, next only to my motherland. I leave the
shores of South Africa with a heavy heart, and the distance that will
now separate me from South Africa will but draw me closer to it, and
its welfare will always be a matter of great concern, and the love
bestowed upon me by my countrymen and the generous forbearance
and kindness extended to me by the Europeans will ever remain a
most cherished treasure in my memory.
I am, etc.,

July 18, 1914
Mr. Gandhi, who was received with cheers, said he thanked them most heartily
and sincerely for the honour they had done his wife and himself on this day of their
departure from the land of their adoption. He thanked those who had framed this
beautiful address for the sentiments that had been expressed. He wished he could
believe with them that he deserved even one tenth of what they, in their generosity,
had been good enough to say about the little service that he might have rendered to

Accompanied by Kasturba, Kallenbach, Mr. & Mrs. Polak and Miss
Schlesin, Gandhiji arrived at Monument Station by the Imperial Mail. The party was
received by a large number of European and Indian friends and was taken in procession
to the Docks. Here Gandhiji was presented with gifts, an address by the Madras Indian
Association, and another telegraphed by Port Elizabeth Indians. After Dr. J. H. Gool
and Dr. Abdurrahman, Cape Town leaders, had eulogized his services, Gandhiji
addressed the gathering.

his countrymen in South Africa. The speeches which had been made by Mr. Gool and
Dr. Abdurrahman had also been tuned similarly, but if he had done anything for his
countrymen in South Africa, that in itself was sufficient reward for him.

You have presented me with costly gifts. If you have at all
followed my life, you would know how inconsistent these gifts are
with the life I have endeavoured to lead, in however small a manner,
during the past few years, the life which I have sketched out for
myself in India. However I take these rich gifts as an indication of
your love, of your sympathy, and your support. May God grant that I
should so behave in India as to retain this love of yours. May God
grant that this love, although distance may separate us, will extend as
the ages go by.
Continuing, Mr. Gandhi said that they had done well in referring to the loss
Lord Hardinge had sustained,1 “that noble Viceroy and faithful friend of ours”, and he
would endeavour to convey their sincere sorrow, in which he heartily joined, to His
Lordship.
It was very hard for him, he said, to part from them, but though he was apart
from them in body, he was sure that in spirit they would be knitted together. It was 21
years ago that he landed on the shores of Natal, when he came as a stranger in their
midst. He did not know any of his countrymen; they did tot know him. He knew not a
single European.2 He had only a vague knowledge of the geography of the country. He
found that he was leaving a country with great resources, with beautiful scenery, and
with a beneficent climate, and certainly, in spite of the hard knocks he had received,
with a people who had the great spiritual view, and one need not fear or despair of a
land which had produced an Olive Schreiner—(cheers.)—W. P. Schreiner, and a John
X. Merriman. (Cheers.) These noble men and women would live when they had gone,
and a land which had produced these noble men and women was a land that had a great
future.
Continuing, he said he would carry away with him happy recollections of
many European friendships that would last when he had gone from South Africa.
Turning and placing his hand on the shoulder of Mr. Kallenbach, he said:

Why, I carry away with me not my blood brother, but my
European brother. Is not that sufficient earnest of what South Africa
has given to me, and is it possible for me to forget South Africa for a

made many friends, some of them his staunchest and most faithful being amongst
Europeans. He had learned to love the country, its beautiful scenery and splendid

single moment? (Cheers.)
Our difficulties, your difficulties are by no means over, but I do
hope [and trust]1 you will treat this generous settlement that has been
given to us in the spirit in which it has been given, backed as it is by
those long-drawn-out sufferings extending over a period of eight
years, backed as it is by those historic debates in both Houses of
Parliament, and backed as it is by the Imperial and Indian Governments—a settlement so well meant, so well conceived should be
fruitful of a great future. But the future is entirely in your own hands.
Let me hope that we shall deserve by our conduct whatever may be in
store for us.
[I] would like to make a final appeal to our European friends
who take an interest in the British Indian question in South Africa. Let
me appeal to them to take a humanitarian view of the question, the
imperial view of the question. Rightly or wrongly, for good or for evil,
Englishmen and Indians have been knit together, and it behoves both
races so to mould themselves as to leave a splendid legacy to the
generations yet to be born, and to show that though Empires have gone and fallen, this Empire perhaps may be an exception and that this
is an Empire not founded on material but on spiritual foundations.
That has been my source of solace all through. I have always
believed there is something subtle, something fine in the ideals of the
British Constitution. Tear away those ideals and you tear away my
loyalty to that Constitution; keep those ideals and I am ever a
bondman. (Cheers.) Both races should see that those ideals of the
British Constitution always remained a sacred treasure.
I say good-bye, farewell. I shall never forget you. So much love,
so much sympathy has overwhelmed me in spite of my trials and
tribulations in South Africa, and that love and that sympathy which I
have received, not only from my fellow countrymen, but from my
European friends, will never be forgotten, but will always remain a
sacred memory. (Cheers.)

Just before s.s. Kinfauns Castle, by which Gandhiji was sailing, weighed
anchor, a Cape Argus representative approached him for “any final remarks he would
like to make”. Of his departure from South Africa Gandhiji later wrote in the
following terms: “I sailed for England, to meet Gokhale on my way back to India,
with mixed feelings of pleasure and regret,—pleasure because I was returning home
after many years and eagerly looked forward to serving the country under Gokhale’s
guidance, regret because it was a great wrench for me to leave South Africa, where I
had passed twenty-one years of my life sharing to the full in the sweets and bitters of
human experience, and where I had realized my vocation in life.” “Conclusion”:
Satyagraha in South Africa.

Gandhiji sent this by wireless to Reuter’s Agency soon after he sailed for
England en route to India.

217. THE LAST SATYAGRAHA CAMPAIGN: PREFACE
[S. S. K INFAUNS CASTLE,

July 23, 1914]
I have left South Africa, but not my connection with that land. I
said in many of my speeches during the final days that I would not
give up that connection. My writings in Indian Opinion will furnish
some proof of my keeping the promise. In them, I shall express my
thoughts from time to time, hoping that readers will like them and
find them useful as well.
I am commencing this article on board the Kinfauns Castle. Five
days have passed since we left the Cape. We are travelling third class,
Mr. Kallenbach, my wife and I. This is my first experience of a
voyage to England in this class. Of first class I have had experience on
several occasions. I must say that we are happier in third class than we
could have been in first. There are no attendants here keeping
constant watch on us. We feel no pricking of conscience that we are
living in special style, segregated from the poor. One does not have
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

263

here the feeling of closeness one has in first class, nor has one to
submit oneself to meaningless conventions. There are no inconveniences in particular. The usual ones which attend on poverty prove
wholesome in the end. I do not mean by these comments of mine that
every Indian should travel third class. I have always felt that those who
are rich and wish to live among the rich must, of course, travel first
class, as a matter of duty at least; otherwise, we are likely to invite the
charge of miserliness. It is certain, however, that travelling in first class
for the sake of better comforts is sinful. Men like me, moreover, who
travel at public expense and whose mode of travelling has no bearing
on the prestige of their community must necessarily travel third class,
or in a still lower class, if there be any.
All three of us live almost entirely on fruit, though we cook fruit
which may not have ripened, or boil things like groundnuts. The
labour is generally Mr. Kallenbach’s. He has at present accepted
manual work as a kind of religion and takes joy in it. For Mr. Kallenbach and my wife, this is the first occasion when they have had no
sea-sickness. I believe it is their simple habits and heir fruit diet which
have made the difference. We are getting more convinced by experience every day that a fruit diet is the best. We hardly ever come into
contact with other passengers. We have divided up our time and do
everything at the appointed hour, so that the days pass easily.
The love of our Indian brethren in their thousands and the
honour they accorded us are constantly in our minds. That love
reminds me of the wonderful power of the soul and its extraordinary
properties. The functions at Durban, Verulam, Johannesburg, Kimberley and Pretoria are, we find, impossible to forget. The Cape Town
friends, moreover, placed us under a crushing burden of gratitude by
taking out a procession. Where so many showed such immeasurable
love, whom shall we thank by name? The white people, too, made an
excellent demonstration of their affection. During the final days, we
drank the cup of their love also full to the brim. Occasions such as
these prove that there is no bar or permanent division as between the
whites and Coloureds and that, if both the sides make the required
effort, the evil in South Africa can be overcome. If one side at least
were to practise satyagraha on every occasion and in every manner, it
is my firm faith, borne out by experience, that even such effort,
one-sided as it would be, would suffice to remove the evil of colour264

218. THE LAST SATYAGRAHA CAMPAIGN:
MY EXPERIENCE2
[After July 23, 1914]
During the last campaign, the very highest limit was reached. I
have had simply no time to write of the experience. I had meant to
share it with the readers of Indian Opinion. They will remember that
the last struggle was, as it were, the third chapter in the story of
satyagraha. When the first chapter came to a close, we, at any rate I,
had thought that it was definitely the last. When the time came for the
second chapter to open, many friends said to me: “Now who will
fight? The community cannot be expected to put forth so much
strength every time.” I laughed when I heard this. My faith in truth
was unshakable and I replied, “The people, having tasted once the joy
of struggle, will fight now with even greater zeal.” And that was
precisely what happened. On the first occasion, a hundred or two
hundred Indians went to gaol. The second time, not only did
hundreds court imprisonment, but the whole of Natal woke up and
leaders came from there to join the struggle. The fight dragged on,
but the morale never went down and we advanced. When it came to
launching the last fight, I heard only talk of defeat. “Every time the
Government deceives you,” they said, “and you allow yourself to be
imposed upon and the people’s interests suffer. This will never do.” I

An editorial note at the end of the article stated that this was followed by a
long account of the latest satyagraha campaign, which had been held back for
publication in the Golden Number of Indian Opinion. Vide the following item.

Gandhiji started writing this article on board the ship after he had prepared
the prefatory one, vide the preceding item. It seems to have been sent to Chhaganlal
Gandhi in two or more instalments. It could not apparently be completed owing to
Gandhiji’s illness and his preoccupation in connection with Indian Ambulance Corps
work in London. Chhaganlal Gandhi collected the different parts of the article for
publication in the Golden Number of Indian Opinion. This special issue also carried a
comprehensive survey of the entire Indian struggle in South Africa and its
implications by the Editor of Indian Opinion; vide Appendix “The Struggle and what
it has meant”.

had to listen to bitter words like these. I knew only too well that
neither I nor anyone else had any remedy against the Government’s
foul play. If, after we have accepted a promissory note, the signatory
refuses to honour it or confesses his inability to do so, how are we to
blame? To me it was clear that, if the Government broke its promise,
though we would have to put in greater efforts, it would have to yield
all the more. The longer the time taken to repay a debt, the heavier the
burden becomes. This unalterable law applies to both material and
moral obligations. My reply at that time was, “Satyagraha is a kind of
struggle in which there can be no defeat and no cause for regret. A
man can only become stronger through the struggle. He suffers no
exhaustion and at every stage he gains fresh strength. If truth be on
our side, the Indian community will work harder this time and earn an
even more glorious name.” When I made this reply, I never dreamt
that 20,000 poor Indians would arise and make their own and their
country’s name immortal. General Botha observed in the course of a
speech that the whites had not been able to start and conduct the kind
of strike that the Indians had done this time. This fight was joined by
women and by many young boys of sixteen, so that the campaign
became much more of a moral struggle. South African Indians
became the talk of the world. In India, rich and poor, young and old,
men and women, kings and labourers, Hindus, Muslims, Parsis,
Christians, citizens of Bombay, Madras, Calcutta and Lahore—all were
roused, became familiar with our history and came to our assistance.
The Government was taken aback. The Viceroy, gauging the mood of
the people, took their side. All this is public knowledge. I am stating
these facts here in order to show the importance of this struggle. My
main purpose in writing this article is to reveal certain details with
which I am particularly familiar, which are not known in India and
even to Indian friends in South Africa.
The training imparted in Tolstoy Farm proved to be of great use
in this last fight. The mode of life accepted by the satyagrahis on the
Farm became an invaluable asset in the struggle. It was copied and
improved upon in Phoenix. When Tolstoy Farm was closed, the pupils
who wished to, came over to Phoenix. The discipline was severe and
there was an understanding with each pupil and his parents that those
of the pupils who chose to live in Phoenix should, provided they were
of a suitable age, join the struggle, if it was launched again. To tell the
truth, the education in Phoenix was for the most part a preparation for
satyagraha. The rules applied also to the families living in Phoenix.
266

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

Only one of them kept aloof. The result was that, leaving aside those
engaged in running Phoenix, all were fully prepared when the
agitation started. Thus the third struggle began with the residents of
Phoenix. I shall never forget the scene when those men, women and
children marched out. Each had but one thought— that this was a
holy war and that all were setting out on a pilgrimage. They set out
singing hymns, one of which was the famous ‘‘Let not thy mind be
affected by joy or sorrow”. The strains of music that issued from the
throats of those men, women and children still echo in my ears. The
great Parsee Rustomjee was among this band. Many had thought that
Mr. Rustomjee had suffered so much in the previous struggle that he
would not join this one. Those who said so did not know his true
greatness. That women and children should go forth and he stay
behind was unthinkable to him. Two other incidents of this period
stand out in my memory. There was an argument between Mr.
Rustomjee and his lion-hearted son, Sorabji, who insisted that he
would accompany his father. “Father, let me go in your place,” he
said, “or take me along with you.”
The second incident was the meeting between the late Hoosen
Mian and Rustomjee. When Mr. Rustomjee went to see him, tears
streamed from his eyes and he said, “Kakaji 1 , if I had been well, I
would have accompanied you to gaol.” Bhai Hoosen loved his
country dearly; though bed-ridden, he gave full support to the
struggle and spoke constantly of it to all who visited him
Among those who remained behind in Phoenix were boys under
sixteen. Although they and the others who managed the affairs of
Phoenix stayed out of prison, they did better work than those who
went to gaol. Day and night were one to them. They placed
themselves under the strictest vows till such time as their companions
and elders should be released, lived on saltless diet and fearlessly took
upon themselves even the most onerous tasks. When the strike began
in Victoria County, hundreds of indentured labourers took shelter in
Phoenix. To have looked after them was in itself a very great
achievement. It was equally an achievement to have gone on doing
their work in complete fearlessness in spite of the danger of raids by
their masters. When the police came and arrested Mr. West, they
prepared themselves for the possibility that others also might be taken.
But not a single person moved out of Phoenix. As I have said already,
1

267

only one family remained an exception. The Indian community can
never truly measure the services that the Phoenix workers rendered to
it at that time. This secret history has yet to be written, that is why I am
recording a part of it here in the hope that some lover of truth might
collect further information and might appreciate the services of the
Phoenix workers at their true worth. I am very much tempted to write
more, but I drop Phoenix here.
When the Phoenix batch went to prison, Johannesburg could not
remain behind. The women there became restive. They were fired with
the desire to be in gaol. The entire family of Mr. Thambi Naidoo got
ready. His wife, sister-in-law, mother-in-law, Mr. Moorgan’s relatives,
Mrs. P. K. Naidoo, Valiamma, who made herself immortal, and
otherwomen came forward. They marched forth with children in their
arms. Mr. Kallenbach took them to Vereeniging. The idea was that,
when they crossed the Free State border and returned, they would be
arrested. Their expectations were not fulfilled. They somehow
managed to spend a few days in Vereeniging, where they tried to get
arrested by going round with baskets, hawking, but they were left free.
This frustration held within itself a glorious future1 . If the
women had been arrested in Vereeniging itself, the strike might not
have taken place; at any rate it would never have reached the
proportions it finally did. But the community was in the [protective]
hand of God. He is ever the protector of truth. When the women were
not arrested, it was decided that they cross the Natal border. If they
were not arrested even there, they were to fix, along with Mr. Thambi
Naidoo, their headquarters at Newcastle. Accordingly, they proceeded
to Natal. At the border, the police did not arrest them. They made
their home in Newcastle. There Mr. D. Lazarus handed over his own
house to the women; his wife and sister-in-law, Miss Thomas, took it
upon themselves to look to the comforts of the women satyagrahis.
The plan was that in Newcastle the women should meet the
indentured labourers and their wives, give them a true idea of their
conditions and persuade them to go on strike on the issue of the £3
tax. The strike was to commence on my arrival at Newcastle. But the
mere presence of these women was like a lighted match-stick to dry
fuel. Women who had never before slept except on soft beds and had
seldom so much as opened their mouths, now delivered public
speeches among the indentured labourers. The latter were roused and,
1

268

Literally, “immortal hope”
THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

even before I arrived, were all for commencing the strike. The project
was full of risk. I got a wire from Mr. Naidoo. Mr. Kallenbach went to
Newcastle and the strike began. By the time I reached there, Indians in
two coal mines had already stopped work.
I was sent for by the Committee of European Sympathizers
presided over by Mr. Hosken. I met them. They approved of the
strike and decided to support it. I stopped for a day at Johannesburg
and proceeded to Newcastle and stayed on there. I saw that the
people’s enthusiasm was tremendous. The Government could not
tolerate the presence of the women and finally they were sent to gaol
as “vagabonds”. The house of Mr. Lazarus now became a dharmsala
for satyagrahis. Food had to be cooked there for hundreds of
indentured labourers. Mr. Lazarus was not to be daunted. The Indians
in Newcastle appointed a committee. Mr. Sidaat was elected chairman,
and the work proceeded apace. Indians in other mines downed tools.
Thus, as the strike by the Indian workers in the mines was
spreading, a meeting of the Mine-Owners’ Association was held. I was
invited to attend.1 A great deal of discussion ensued but no
solution was found. Their proposal was that, if we called off the strike,
they would undertake to write to the Government about the
£3 tax. This, the satyagrahis could not agree to. We had no
quarrel with the mine-owners. The object of the strike was not to hurt
them but rather to invite suffering on ourselves. And so the suggestion
of the owners was unacceptable. I returned to Newcastle. when I
reported the result of this meeting, enthusiasm mounted still higher.
Work stopped in more mines.
Till then the workers had always resided at the mines where they
worked. The Council of Action in Newcastle felt that, as long as the
labourers continued to live on their masters’ estates, the strike would
not have its full effect. There was the risk that they might be either
tempted or coerced to resume work. Then again, to live in the
master’s house or eat his bread while refusing to work for him would
be immoral. The workers’ continued stay on the mines was morally
wrong. This last taint, it was felt, would sully the purity of the
satyagraha movement. On the other hand, to house and feed
thousands of Indians was a stupendous problem. Mr. Lazarus’ house
was now too small. The two poor ladies laboured night and day but
found it impossible to cope with the work. It was decided, even in the
1

VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

269

face of this, to adopt only the right course, whatever the cost.
Messages were sent to miners to stop work and proceed to Newcastle.
The moment these messages were received, an exodus from the mines
began. Indians from the Belangi mine were the first to arrive. It
appeared as though bands of pilgrims were daily streaming into
Newcastle. Men young and old, women—some by themselves, others
with children in their arms —all arrived with bundles on their heads.
The men, one saw, were carrying trunks. Some arrived by day, others
by night and food had to be provided for them. How can I describe
the contentment of these poor people? They were pleased with what
they got, no matter how little. Rarely did one come across anyone with
a downcast look. A smile played on every face. To me they appeared
to have come from among the 33 crores of gods. The women were
like goddesses. From where could shelter be provided for all? For
bedding, straw was spread on the earth and the sky was their roof.
Godwas their protector. Someone asked for a bidi 1 . I explained that
they had come out, not as indentured labourers, but as servants of
India. They were taking part in a religious war and at such a time they
must abandon addictions such as drinking and smoking. Those who
were unable to give them up should not expect their requirements to
be paid for from the common coffers. The good men accepted this
advice. I was never again asked for money to buy a bidi. The exodus
from the mines continued. One pregnant woman had a miscarriage on
the way. In spite of numberless hardships of this kind, no one gave up
the struggle or turned back.
There was a tremendous increase in the Indian population of
Newcastle. The houses of Indians were over-filled. The number made
available was enough to accommodate women and old people. I must
state here that the white people of Newcastle showed us great courtesy,
even sympathy. No Indian was harassed by them. One good lady even
gave her house free for our use; other assistance of a minor nature was
also received from a number of whites all the time.
It was, however, not possible to keep thousands of Indians
permanently in Newcastle. The Mayor became apprehensive. The normal population of Newcastle is about three thousand. An additional
ten thousand could not be accommodated in such a town. Labourers
stopped work in other mines too. And so the question arose: what
should be done? The intention behind the strike was to court imp1

risonment. The Government could have arrested the workers if it had
so wished, but there were not enough prisons to house those thousands. Hence, they had not so far touched the strikers. The one simple
way left to us now was to cross the Transvaal border and get arrested.
We thought that the congestion in Newcastle would thereby be
relieved and the strikers could also be put to the test. In Newcastle, the
agents of the mine-owners were trying to lure away the workers. Not a
single person had yielded; even so, it was the duty of the Council of
Action to keep them away from all temptation. It seemed desirable,
therefore, that they should march from Newcastle to Charlestown. The
distance is about 35 miles. To provide railway fare for thousands was
out of the question. It was therefore arranged that all able-bodied men
and women should do the journey on foot. The women who could not
walk were to be taken by train. There was a possibility of arrests on
the way. Moreover, this was the first experience of its kind for them. It
was therefore decided that I should myself take the first batch. It
consisted of about 500 persons of whom 60 were women, with their
children. I shall never forget that scene. The company walked along
raising cries of “Victory to Dwarkanath”, “Victory to Ramachandra” and “Vande Mataram”. Each person was given enough
cooked rice and dal to last for two days. Everyone carried his or her
things in a bundle. The following conditions were read out to them:
l.

It was probable that I would be arrested. Even if this
happened, they were to march on until arrested themselves.
Though every effort would be made to provide them with
meals, etc., on the way, they should not mind, if by chance,
food was not available on some day.
For the duration of the struggle, they should abstain from
drinks.
They must not retreat even in the face of death.
They should expect no shelter for night halts during the
march, but should sleep on the grass.
No trees or plants on the way should be harmed in the least
nor should any article belonging to others be touched.
If the Government’s police came to arrest anyone, the latter
should willingly surrender.
No resistance should be offered to the police or any others;
on the contrary, beating should be patiently borne and no

271

attempt should be made to protect oneself by offering
violence in return.
8. They should cheerfully bear the hardships in gaol and live
there as if the gaol were a palace.
There were persons of every caste and community in this
pilgrim-band. There were Hindus, Muslims, Brahmins, Kshatriyas,
Vaishyas and Sudras. There were men from Calcutta and there were
Tamils. Several Pathans and Sindhis from the North found it difficult
to accept the conditions requiring them to refrain from defending
themselves in case they were beaten; not only did they accept it,
however, but, when the testing time came, they actually made no move
to defend themselves.
And so, the first batch started on its march. On the very first
night, we had the experience of sleeping out on the grass. On the way,
warrants were received for the arrest of about 150 persons and they
surrendered themselves readily. A single police officer had come to
make the arrests. He had no assistant; how the arrested men were to be
taken away became a problem. We were only 6 miles from Charlestown. So I suggested to the officer that these persons could proceed
along with me and that he should take them into custody at Charlestown, or do whatever he thought fit after obtaining instructions from
his superiors. The officer agreed and left us. We arrived at Charlestown. This is a very small township, with a population of barely 1,000.
There is only one main road and the Indian population is negligible.
The whites were amazed, therefore, at the sight of our party. At no
time had so many Indians appeared in Charlestown. There was no
train ready to convey the prisoners to Newcastle. Where could the
police keep them? There was not enough room for all these arrested
persons at the Charlestown police station. And so, the police handed
them over to me and agreed to pay for their food. This is no small
tribute to satyagraha. In the ordinary course of things, how could
people arrested from among us be placed in our charge? If some of
them had escaped, the responsibility would not have been ours. But
everyone knew that it was the job of the satyagrahis to court arrest and
they had, therefore, full confidence in us. The arrested men thus
stayed with us for four days more. When the police were ready to take
charge of them, they went away willingly.
More and more people were being recruited to our party. On
some days 400 would join, on others even more. Many arrived on
272

foot, while women came mostly by train. These were put up wherever
there was space in the houses of Indian merchants of Charlestown.
The local Corporation also offered us houses. The whites did not give
us the slightest trouble. On the contrary, they went out of their way to
help us. One Dr. Briscoe took it upon himself to give us free medical
aid and, when we proceeded beyond Charlestown, he gave us gratis
some expensive medicines and useful instruments. Our food was
cooked in the mosque premises. The fire had to remain lit all the
twenty-four hours. The cooks came from among the strikers. During
the final days, four to five thousand persons were being fed. Yet these
workers never lost heart. In the morning, the meal consisted of mealie
pap with sugar and some bread. In the evening they had rice, dal and
vegetables. Most people in South Africa eat thrice a day. The
indentured labourers always have three meals, but during the struggle
they remained content with only two. They like to have small
delicacies with their meals, but these, too, they gave up at this time.
What to do with these huge crowds of people became a problem.
If they were kept somehow in Charlestown, there was the likelihood of
an epidemic breaking out. Moreover, it was not desirable that so many
thousands accustomed to hard work should be kept in a state of
idleness. It needs to be mentioned here that, although so many poor
people had come together in Charlestown, not one of them
committeda theft. The police had never to be called and they had no
extra work on our account. However, it seemed best not to keep
waiting in Charlestown. It was therefore decided to proceed to the
Transvaal and, if not arrested, to go on ultimately to Tolstoy Farm.
Before commen-cing the march, the Government was informed that
we were procee-ding to the Transvaal to court arrest, that we had no
desire to stay there or to claim any rights, but that, as long as the
Government did not arrest us, we would continue our march and
finally stay on Tolstoy Farm. If, however, the Government promised
to withdraw the £3 tax, we were willing to return. But the Government
was in no mood to consider this notice. It was misled by its informants
who assured it that the strikers would soon be exhausted. The
Government had a notice printed in all languages and distributed
among the strikers.
At last the time came for us to proceed beyond Charlestown. On
November 6, a party of 3,000 left at day-break. The procession was
more than a mile long. Mr. Kallenbach and I were at the rear. The
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

procession reached the border where a police party stood in readiness.
When the two of us reached the spot, we had a talk with the police.
They refused to arrest us and the procession went on in a disciplined
and peaceful manner through Volksrust. On reaching Standerton
Road outside the town, we halted and had some refreshments. It had
been arranged that women should not join in this march, but later it
became impossible to check the tide of enthusiasm and a few women
managed to accompany the procession. However, some women and
children still remained behind in Charlestown. After crossing the
border at Volksrust, Mr. Kallenbach was sent back to look after them.
On the following day, the police arrested me near Palmford. I
was charged with having brought unauthorized persons into the
Transvaal. There was no warrant for the arrest of anyone else.
Therefore, on reaching Volksrust, I sent the following telegram1 to the
Government.
The procession went ahead. I was produced before the
magistrate at Volksrust. I did not, of course, wish to defend myself.
But as some arrangements had yet to be made regarding those who
had gone beyond Palmford and those left behind at Charlestown, I
asked for time. The Government pleader objected, but the magistrate
pointed out that bail could be refused only in a case of murder. He
then asked me to furnish a bail of £50 and gave me time for a week.
The amount was immediately paid by a merchant in Volksrust. As
soon as I was released, I went straight to the marchers. Their enthusiasm was doubled. Meanwhile, a wire came from Pretoria to say that
the Government had no intention of arresting the Indians who were
with me. Only the leaders were to be arrested. This did not mean that
all the rest would be allowed to go free. But the Government had no
desire to make our work easy by arresting all of us or to provoke
agitation in India on this account.
Mr. Kallenbach followed with another large batch. Our party of
over 2,000 was nearing Standerton. There, I was again arrested and the
hearing was fixed for the 21st. We, however, proceeded on our way.
But now the Government could stand this no longer and it took the
step of separating me from the rest. At this time, preparations were
afoot to send Mr. Polak to India with a deputation. He came to see me
before leaving. But “our undertakings remain unfinished, and the will

of God prevails”. This is what happened. On Sunday I was arrested,
for the third time, near Greylingstad. The warrant this time was issued
from Dundee and the charge was that of instigating the workers to
stop work. I was removed from there to Dundee in utmost secrecy. I
have mentioned above that Mr. Polak was in the march with us. He
now took charge. My case came up for hearing in Dundee on
Tuesday. All three charges against me were read out and I pleaded
guilty to all of them. I then made, with the Court’s permission, the
following statement.1
I made myself quite comfortable in gaol. Afterwards, proceedings were taken against me in Volksrust and I was given another
three months of gaol, besides the nine months I got at Dundee.
About this time, I learnt that Mr. Polak had been arrested and
that instead of going to India he found himself in gaol. I, for one, was
delighted, because this, to my mind, was a far more weighty
deputation than the other one. Soon after this, Mr. Kallenbach was
arrested and he also, like Mr. Polak, found himself lodged in gaol for
three months. The Government was sadly mistaken when it imagined
that, once the leaders were arrested, the people would surrender. All
the strikers were put into four special trains and taken to mines in
Dundee and Newcastle. They were subjected to much cruelty and they
suffered terribly. But they had come forward to suffer. They were
their own leaders. They had to demonstrate their strength, left as they
were without any leaders, so called; and they did so. How well they did
is known to all the world.
Rightly indeed has Dayaram2 sung:
Who without utmost suffering has attained to a vision of
Krishna?
Find any, if you can, among the saints of the four ages;
Rare are the men who have much love for a Vaishnava;
Persecutors all and enemies to bhakti.
Dhruva and Prahlad, Bhishma, Bali and Vibhishana,
Vidur and Kunti, with her princes, were all ill-used.

[ON BOARD S HIP,]

Shravan Sud 6 [July 28, 1914] 1
CHI. CHHAGANLAL,

Go on writing to Nayak about the money due from him. Take
Motilal’s help as well. I am writing to Nayak.
It is only today that I write this letter. The note above was set
down lest I should forget the thing. All three of us2 are keeping
excellent health. Ba behaves wonderfully. She gives no trouble about
food. She has reduced the intake of wheat to a minimum. She lives for
the most part on raw banana, boiled groundnut and milk. After the
wheat bati brought from there has run out, she is inclined to give up
even wheat for the present. For one hour I teach Gujarati to
Kallenbach and for one hour, at seven in the evening, I explain the
Gita to Ba and read the Ramayana to her. She attends to both with
great interest. I do not feel any of the inconveniences usual in the
third class, but see many advantages. We do not come into contact
with other passengers and that saves us plenty of time. We have
framed time-tables and the fixed routine is never upset. The Company
has stocked all fruit so that we get bananas, oranges, etc., in plenty. It
also supplies almonds, etc. If any cooking has to be done, it is
attended to by Mr. Kallenbach.
The party3 who were to leave for India must have done so and,
therefore, I address nothing to them.
The separation this time was a very painful experience. I received
much love in Phoenix. “The creeper of love I have planted and
watered with tears.”4 I can utter this from my own experience and rich
has been the harvest I have reaped.
I am sending plenty of material and you will see that I have not
finished. I shall send more after leaving Madeira, that is, post it from
Southampton. I hope I shall not let you run short of matter.

through divine inspiration that my eyes rested on you. So far, I have
not been disappointed in you. I pray God to give you strength so that
I may never be. Strive to observe the five yamas all your life.
Win everyone’s love in Phoenix. That is the way of daya
(charity). Think over the deep implications of daya. I have just
finished reading Yogadipaka. I read in it that the atman advances
through action that is natural to it and falls back through action that is
contrary to its nature. I found this definition of swadharma1 more
convincing [than the usual one] 2 . I would very much like to go on
writing, but my time-table will not permit my doing so. You will,
however, be able to develop these ideas further.

therefore, with much shorter letters to Raojibhai3 and Pragji.4

changed much.
Remain firm in the vows you have taken. Cling to them like a
fanatic. You will then be able to win over M[anibhai], conquer the

freedom. In other words, one single key ensures victory of every kind,

Increase still further the simplicity we have adopted. You were
free so long as I was there. Consider yourself in prison now. Do not
let the palate run away with you. Do not tell yourself, ‘I may have this,

now I will of this too,’ and so be victorious.
Keep me fully informed how you live. Live with Shri Pragji as
with a blood brother. Give your whole-hearted attention to agriculture,
spread your fragrance all over Phoenix and see that the place grows

Do not give up Tamil. Get into the habit of speaking with

222. SPEECH AT LONDON RECEPTION1
August 8, 1914
To you, Mr. Basu, and to Mrs. Sarojini Naidu, I can only say
that you have both overwhelmed me; I do not even know that I can
struggle through what I have to say. I would make the briefest
reference to the tremendous crisis2 which has overwhelmed the
Empire. Since we reached England and heard the news, I have been
reading and thinking about it. I think of husbands and sons who have
gone to fight, of mothers, wives, and sisters left weeping behind. I ask:
‘What is my duty? I am an exile of 21 years from my Motherland, so
cannot speak as the representative of the imaginary India which my
friends tell me I have pictured.’ If I were in South Africa, I should
certainly speak as the representative of my people. I have not yet
come to any conclusion, but trust we can do something in concrete
shape. I hope those of you who are as young as I am, those who are
fellow-students of mine—I am still a student—will think what can be
done, consult with our elders and follow their advice if it commends
itself to our consciences.
It is impossible to express in adequate terms the sense of

gratitude which Mrs. Gandhi and I feel to you all. We come among
you almost as barbarians. We have lived isolated on a little farm, cut
off from the cities. That is why I said we were “barbarians”. We have
worked in the limelight, and you have seen what we have done in
exaggerated form. If we merit any approbation, how much more those
behind us, who went into the battle with simple faith, with no thought
of appreciation.
What will you say to Hurbatsingh, an ex-indentured Indian,
75 years of age, who was with me at Volksrust Gaol? He was 6 feet tall
and of noble carriage. “Why have you come?” I asked. “How could
I help it?” was his reply. “In the evening of my days I am content to
pass the rest of my life in prison to deliver my countrymen.” He
remained in gaol and died there.
What do you think of the young lad, Narayansamy, whose
parents came from what is falsely called the Benighted Presidency,
Madras? He had never seen India except as a deportee; he starved for
some days when he returned. He died.
And what of Nagappen, another lad from Madras who suffered
imprisonment. He worked as a prisoner on the African veldt in the
bitter cold of winter, in the early morning when there was no sun. You
know what the cold of a London winter is like, but few of you know
the biting cold of the early mornings of winter on the veldt. Unfit for
work, he still held on, but at last he died.
Then there is Sister Valliamma, a girl of 18. She went to prison
and was only discharged when she was very ill. I remember well when
Mr. Polak and I went to see her; how we lifted her with greatest care
on to her carpet, and tended her to the best of our powers. She died,
leaving thousands of Indians in South Africa to mourn the loss.
There were 20,000 strikers who left their tools and work because
there was something in the air. People said that they did not know why
they had struck. There was a half-truth in that saying; they went out in
faith. Violence was entirely eschewed. These men and women are the
salt of India; on them will be built the Indian nation that is to be. We
are poor mortals before these heroes and heroines.
But victory is due not only to their work. They quickened the
conscience of the Empire and of South Africa. Success was due also
to the help given by the Motherland in the hour of trial of her sons
and daughters, led by that saintly politician, Gopal Krishna Gokhale;
to the stand made by India; and to the action of that great Viceroy,
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

281

Lord Hardinge. Success would, however, have been impossible had
not the conscience of South Africa been quickened, had not the
people realised the moral force which Indians could bring to bear
against brute-force.
Marching over the veldt last November, Europeans came to our
aid. I have spoken elsewhere of unreasonable and unreasoning
prejudice; but the masses stood aside; they never worried us; and
during the march they helped us and showed us practical sympathy.
The Botha Government, too, “played the game”. Mr. Smuts
said to me: “We do not want any misunderstanding; we want all the
cards on the table. Take these documents; read them; come to me
again and again if you are not satisfied; we will make changes.” And
he did.
You see many things conspired to enable the Settlement to be
made. But I must mention one more: Mr. Andrews. You have no
notion what he did; how he worked in selfless zeal, preaching love for
India through his Master—the poet-saint at Bolpur whom I have come
to know through Mr. Andrews—Rabindranath Tagore.
I have called the Settlement the Magna Charta of the British
Indians of South Africa; after due deliberation I repeat my statement.
It is the Magna Charta of British Indians, not only because of its
substance, which is great enough, but for its spirit, which indicates a
change of attitude on the part of South Africa and the South African
Government. The sufferings of our countrymen sealed the Settlement.
The discovery was made that the ancient force could be applied in
South Africa; conviction came after the sufferings of eight
long-drawn-out years. They saw that Indians, when in earnest, were
irresistible; that they would not take a bit less than the minimum they
demanded.
Mr. Cartwright is here; he has been our staunch friend
throughout and I honour him for his help. But I tell him here that he
almost tried to weaken us. I remember, and he will remember how he
came to me in Johannesburg Gaol, and said: “Will not this letter do?”
“No, Mr. Cartwright,” was my reply; “not until this alteration is
made.” “But everything is achieved by compromise,” he urged.
“There can be no compromise on principles,” I answered. There
never was any compromise on principles from 1906 to 1914.
The Settlement is final on all the points of our passive resistance,
but not of all our grievances. Grievances remain which will have to be
282

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

redressed in no distant future. But I hope it will not be by way of
passive resistance. They are capable of settlement by pressure of
Indian public opinion, by pressure from Downing Street, and from
Delhi or Calcutta. The attitude of South Africa has changed; that is
our greatest asset. On our behaviour depends the future settlement in
South Africa.
I thank again, on behalf of Mrs. Gandhi and myself, Mr. Basu
and Mrs. Naidu for all their kind words. But you have only seen the
bright side; you do not know our weaknesses. Indians are altogether
too generous; they overlook faults and magnify virtues; this had
led us to incarnating our heroes. I think of what is written in our
scriptures—that it is our duty to fly away from praises, we
must lay them all at the feet of the Almighty. I hope we have enough
courage, and courage to lay them at His feet, in whose name and in
the name of Mother India we have endeavoured to do our duty, but
nothing but our duty.

C OLONIAL OFFICE, S.W.
SIR,

Mr. Hermann Kallenbach is a German by birth, his parents
having migrated from Russia and settled in Germany at the border
town of Russ, East Prussia. He is a Jew by religion, an architect by
profession. He has settled in South Africa for the last 18 years. He is
owner of Tolstoy Farm in the Transvaal and considerable other landed
property in the same Province.
He has been connected with my activity in South Africa for the
last 10 years and has come with me, both of us being on our way to
India.
Mr. Kallenbach never formally became a British subject, but as
he was coming with me to India, both of us came to the conclusion
that it would be better for him to become naturalised. Before,
therefore, we left South Africa, that is before the 18th July, he filed his
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

283

application for naturalisation with the Secretary for the Interior at
Pretoria. He was to have taken the oath of allegiance in India, where
his papers were to follow him. Owing to the crisis, both Mr.
Kallenbach and I are now stranded here and both of us hope shortly
to be able to offer our services as non-combatants during the crisis
that has overtaken the Empire.
I write this, however, to ascertain whether, as Mr. Kallenbach
does not yet hold the certificate of naturalisation, he is to take any
steps in connection with the notices published requiring Germans to
register themselves.
In any event, Mr. Kallenbach wishes to place himself entirely at
the disposal of the authorities.
I have the honour to remain,

We, the undersigned have, after mature deliberation, decided for
the sake of the Motherland and the Empire to place our services
unconditionally, during this crisis, at the disposal of the Authorities.
We advisedly use the word ‘unconditionally’ as we believe that, at a
moment like this, no service that can be assigned to us can be considered to be beneath our dignity or inconsistent with our self-respect.

TO

It was thought desirable by many of us that, during the crisis
that has overtaken the Empire and whilst many Englishmen, leaving
their ordinary vocation in life, are responding to the Imperial call,
those Indians who are residing in the United Kingdom and who can at
all do so, should place themselves unconditionally at the disposal of
the Authorities.
With a view of ascertaining the feeling of the resident Indian
population, the undersigned sent out a circular letter to as many
Indians in the United Kingdom as could be approached during the 30
hours that the organisers gave themselves. The response has been
generous and prompt and, in the opinion of the undersigned,
representative of His Majesty’s subjects from the Indian Empire at
present residing in the different parts of the United Kingdom.
On behalf of ourselves and those whose names appear on the list
appended hereto, we beg to offer our services to the Authorities. We
venture to trust that the Right Hon’ble the Marquess of Crewe will
approve of our offer and secure its acceptance by the proper
authority. We would respectfully emphasise the fact that the one
dominant idea guiding us is that of rendering such humble assistance
as we may be considered capable of performing, as an earnest of our
desire to share the responsibilities of membership of this great Empire,
if we would share its privileges.
It may be added that some of those whose names are sent
herewith are already doing work in connection with some of the
organisations that are already rendering assistance, and we have no
doubt that, if our humble offer is accepted, as the news permeates the
Indian community, many more volunteers will come forward.1

226. LETTER TO C. ROBERTS
[LONDON,]

August 24, 1914
DEAR MR. ROBERTS,

You have no doubt heard of Mr. Hermann Kallenbach who has
been associated with the Indian movement in South Africa for the last
10 years. His parents originally came from Russia and settled in
Germany at Russ, East Prussia. Mr. Kallenbach was born there and has
been a German subject. He has settled in South Africa for the last 18
years and has carried on the profession of an architect. He is owner of
considerable landed property in the Transvaal. Not having exercised
the duties required of German citizens in the Transvaal, Mr.
Kallenbach forfeited, according to German law, the rights of German
nationality.As he was accompanying me to India before we left South
Africa, both of us came to the conclusion that he should become
naturalised. He, therefore, completed his application for naturalisation
on the 15th July last at Johannesburg. And instructions were left with
his solicitor to forward the certificate to his Indian address, as we did
not expect to stay in London for any length of time. He was to have
taken the oath of allegiance in India.
As I do not know what Mr. Kallenbach’s legal status exactly is,
for his protection, I have placed the above facts before the Colonial
Office and am now awaiting their answer.
Mr. Kallenbach is desirous of joining the Indian Volunteer
Corps and taking First Aid instruction in the class that is being formed
under Dr. Cantlie. But he does not wish to take any such steps without
the knowledge and approval of the India Office. Will you kindly
consider the matter and, if this letter reaches you in time, favour me
with your reply before Wednesday morning; the class, as you know,
commences at 10 a.m. that day.
I remain,
Yours truly,

As my affairs are in a mess, I do not know what to write. I am
attending these days one of the training classes 2 recently started for
nursing the wounded. All told, we are 59 Indians in this class, which
will run for three weeks. After that, I may have some idea when I shall
be there [in India]. There may be some difficulty, perhaps, about Mr.
Kallenbach’s going. 3 In that case, my departure is likely to be
delayed. I have been coming up against one obstacle after another to
my going to India.
You may commence writing to me. All of you are on your
trial there. Use money with the utmost care. Let everyone be
scrupulous in observing the various restrictions on food. That will
keep you collected both in body and mind and bring credit to
Phoenix. I am not writing this time to everyone. Next week, I may
possibly get more time. Send me a list of the persons in your party.4
I read in Indian Opinion that all of you were honoured in

I wrote a letter to you last week.1 I hope you get all my letters.
Here I am quite engrossed in work. It seems that one who wants to do
his duty should expect no leisure.
Today we had an examination in first aid. I too had to read a
lot. The questions were as follows: “What is the cure for opium
poisoning?” “What is the treatment for a broken collarbone?”
“What should be done to stop bleeding from a wound in the palm?”
We are 70 Indians in the class. From tomorrow begins the next
session. And, besides, I must see all these volunteers who keep turning
up. There is no knowing what the outcome of the War will be, or
whether we shall have to go on special duty. Things are thus in an
uncertain state. Ba keeps excellent health. My weakness has not
disappeared yet, thanks to fasting. Mr. Kallenbach is learning
Gujarati. I am yearning for letters from you all.
This letter is for all of you to read. I see that you will be tried
much more severely than we thought. For the present, I do not write
separately to Maganbhai, Manilal, Jamnadas, and others. I shall see
next week. Keep writing to me. I am anxious to hear about the health
of Maganbhai and Santok.
Blessings from

229. LETTER TO MAGANLAL GANDHI
[LONDON,]

Bhadarva Vad 13 [September 18, 1914]
CHI. MAGANLAL,

I had no time last week to write to you. Most of the time is spent
in the training class for first aid to the injured and the rest with Mr.
Gokhale. He is keeping good health at present. They will give us
training for two more months and then send us to the front. This
means that my going to India in the immediate future is out of the
question, unless the War suddenly comes to an end.
All of you may want to know why I have undertaken even the
nursing of the wounded. Recently, I used to say, in South Africa, that,
as satyagrahis we cannot help in this way either, for such help also
amounted to supporting a war. One who would not help a slaughterhouse should not help in cleaning the butcher’s house either. But I
found that, living in England, I was in a way participating in the War.
London owes the food it gets in war time to the protection of the
Navy. Thus to take this food was also a wrong thing. There was only
one right course left, which was to go away to live in some mountainor
cave in England itself and subsist there on whatever food or shelter
Nature might provide, without seeking assistance from any human
being. I do not yet possess the spiritual strength necessary for this. It
seemed to me a base thing, therefore, to accept food tainted by war
without working for it. When thousands have come forward to lay
down their lives only because they thought it their duty to do so, how
could I sit still? A rifle this hand will never fire. And so there only
remained nursing the wounded and I took it up. This is how I
communed to myself. I cannot say for certain that the step I have
taken is the right one. I have thought much about the matter though,
but so far I have discovered no alternative.
My guess is that we shall be here for at least four months more.
The War should not go on longer than that. Ba is keeping good
health. She can even walk long distances. Here she has given up wheat
as well. She takes only milk in addition to what I do. Mr. Kallenbach,
too, enjoys excellent health. He keeps up his study of Gujarati. Mr.
Sorabji sees me every day. He has joined the War along with me. We
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

289

are 70 in the class. He has passed the first examination, that is, the
entrance examination [for the Bar]. He will take three more years to
be called to the bar. I am growing more convinced with experience
that coming here for degrees serves no useful purpose whatsoever.
The students’ plight is pitiable. Maybe they do get some education,
but they learn nothing. Their character is ruined. Perhaps the coming
over of a very small number may be useful (only at a mature age,
though).
All of you should read this letter. Make a copy and send the
original to Dr. Mehta. Send the copy to Harilal. Write to me regularly
at this address: 84-85, Palace Chambers, Westminster, London. I do
not write separately to the others. This may be taken, therefore, as
meant for all.
You must be finding yourselves in a trying situation indeed, all
of you. I pray to God to be your help and to give you the firmness of
mind to do your duty. Send a copy of this letter to Samaldas1 also. He
should join us. Who knows when I shall be able to bow down my head
before the sisters-in-law. I am eager to know if Maganbhai has been to
his people. See if you can arrange for [teaching] Tamil to Fakiri 2
andKuppu 3 . You may see Mr. Natarajan 4. 4 He will guide you. Ask
everyone to write to me. Tell me how things are with Kalyandas55 .

[LONDON,]

Bhadarva Vad 14 [September 19, 1914]
CHI. CHHAGANLAL,

I still hesitate to send you what I have written, so afraid I am
about the post. There have been no letters from you so far by the
latest mail. To me this country seems like poison. My soul is in India.
I am, however, staying on because I think I must. I want to write more
about this but I have neither the time for it just now, nor the mood. Do
go on writing to me here. Give my salaams to Imam Saheb. I wish to
write again to him. I do not know, though, when I shall be able to do
so. Ask Raojibhai and Pragji to write.
I have given £190 to Sorabji for admission to the Bar. Debit that
to Dr. Mehta’s account and send me a draft for the amount by
registered post. If I am not here, the letter will follow me to India.

231. CIRCULAR REGARDING TRAINING CORPS1
September 22, 1914
In response to a desire widely expressed by Indian students
resident in the United Kingdom to take some active part in the
defence of the country and in service abroad, it has been decided to
organise a Field Ambulance Training Corps in connection with
theRed Cross Society, and to give members of this Corps, when
adequa-tely trained, an opportunity of serving with the Indian Army
in Europe. The nucleus of such a Corps has already been formed in
London, and drilled and trained for some weeks under Dr. James
Cantlie, and steps are now being taken, with the co-operation of the
War Office and the authorities of the London University Officers’

Training Corps, to expand and develop this nucleus into a highly
organised corps. The Government of India has given its sanction, and
Lieutenant-Colonel Baker of the Indian Medical Service (retired) has
consented to act as Commander of the Corps.
Indian gentlemen desirous of joining it should send in their
names without delay to the Indian Volunteers Committee, 60, Talbot
Road, Bayswater, London.
The Corps is intended mainly for residents in London; but
Indian students from other centres will be admitted if they desire to
join. Men with medical training will be able to undertake special
duties, but all men willing to train and serve will be of use. Applicants
will be asked to enrol themselves in the Indian Field Ambulance
Training Corps, and will require to be passed by a Medical Board as
physically fit. They will then be drilled almost every day by trained
instructors in London, at an hour which will not interfere unduly with
their ordinary studies or occupations; and at each week-end they will
be expected to go into camp for further training from Friday night to
Monday morning. A camping ground within easy reach of London
will be placed at the disposal of the Corps, and uniforms and equipment will be procured. After some weeks of training—which will
involve hard and steady work—they will, when efficient, be entitled to
volunteer to serve for six months as a Detachment under the Red
Cross Society in connection with the Indian troops abroad. The terms
and conditions of such service will be announced later. But it is hoped
that the Red Cross Society will be able, in the first instance, to find
places in the Detachment sent abroad for 10 Medical Officers and for
50 other recruits who would serve as Nursing Orderlies, Dressers,
Compounders, Bearers, &c. The rates of pay on active service will
probably be 20s. per day for Medical Officers and 4s. per day, with
free rations, for the rest. Preference in the filling of these places would
be given to recruits who, in the opinion of the Commanding Officer,
were the most efficiently trained.

232. LETTER TO DR. ABDURRAHMAN
[LONDON,

October 1. 1914]
DEAR DR. ABDURRAHMAN

I think you should inform the Minister that you represent not
only the Malay community but the other Mahomedans also who are
not Malays. At the same time, a statement of your case should
certainly be submitted to him. You will read in this week’s Indian
Opinion counsel’s opinion which would show you that the resident
Mahomedans are also affected by the judgement. What you desire is
that (you will tell him) non-Christian marriages celebrated according
to the rites of the respective religions of the parties should be
recognised and that if a deputation was received a way out of the
difficulty might be found and further that the Minister will then notice
the intensity of the feeling roused. I hope that you will be satisfied
with nothing less than an alteration of the Law—no assurances can be
accepted as sufficient.
Yours sincerely,

233. SPEECH TO INDIAN FIELD AMBULANCE CORPS1
[LONDON,

October 1, 1914]
Mr. Gandhi spoke of Dr. Cantlie’s splendid spirit in all the work that had been
done, but added that, if he had one weakness, it was his keen desire “to make us wear
kilts in order to keep ourselves thoroughly warm!” The one who laughed longest and

At a public meeting held at the Polytechnic Institution, Regent Street, the
Indian Voluntary Aid Corps, which was trained by Dr. James Cantlie in First Aid,
Sanitation and Hygiene, received recognition from the War Office as the Indian Field
Ambulance Corps. Col. R. J. Baker, an ex-member of the Indian Medical Corps, took
over charge of further instruction. Gandhiji presided over the meeting which was
addressed by the Aga Khan and attended, among others, by Kasturba, Sarojini Naidu,
Ameer Ali and Kallenbach. Earlier, Gandhiji presented Dr. Cantlie with a set of
Tagore’s works in appreciation of his services to the Corps.

loudest was Dr. Cantlie himself. To the Directors of the Polytechnic Institution Mr.
Gandhi also paid a fine and deserved tribute; it has made a home for the Indian Corps,
given them the use of its splendid equipment, of its rooms and halls, of its many
facilities, for practically nothing because dominated by the spirit of patriotism and
service.
When speaking of H. H. the Aga Khan—to “introduce” him, said Mr. Gandhi,
would be an impertinence, especially by one who had been for more than twenty years
an exile from his Motherland—Mr. Gandhi, as might be expected, fastened upon the
offer of His Highness to serve as a private in the British ranks in this time of crisis. It
was a noble example set by one to whom every avenue in the army might be open; it
would comfort, encourage and cheer the Indian Corps, who would gladly serve His
Highness. A word was added about the unfailing encouragement and substantial
financial help which His Highness had always given to the struggle in South Africa,
of his help to Mr. Gokhale in his strenuous work on behalf of the Indians in South
Africa, and of the thrill of joy which touched not only the hearts of the Aga Khan’s
followers, of whom there were some in the midst of the struggle, but of all Indians,
irrespective of creed.1
Mr. Gandhi afterwards expressed on behalf of Hindus complete sympathy with
Mussulmans in their resentment of Mr. Lloyd George’s words, and made the suggestion that they should raise a farthing subscription and present to the Chancellor of
the Exchequer an authentic narrative which would prove that the Prophet of Islam was
not the monster he thought him to be.

234. LETTER TO COL. R. J. BAKER
LONDON,

October 13, 1914
DEAR COLONEL BAKER,

I thank you for your note of today’s date, supplemented by the
message sent by you, verbally, through Mr. Venkatraman who was
good enough to take [my] note to you.
I am aware that strict military discipline requires that all
complaints by members of a Corps should be sent to the commanding
officer through section leaders. I am also aware of the fact that, in the
military sense, I am no more than any other private, but I have been
1

294

The gathering was then addressed by the Aga Khan,
THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

under the belief that in the interests of the Corps, and unofficially, I
would be allowed to act as a humble channel of communication
between you and the members of the Corps, so as to avoid any friction
or stiffness, especially in the initial stages, when the members who
have never undergone military discipline are likely to
misunderstandexperiences which may be quite new to them. I also
thought that you would not mind recognising my representative
capacity as Chairman of the Volunteer Corps, and would not resent
my approaching you in the matters affecting the Corps, and it was in
that belief that, being entirely a cripple, I took the liberty of inviting
you to my room so that we could have a mutual discussion, which I
have always known to be far more satisfactory than letter-writing, and
if you think it worth while, I would still ask you to favour me with a
call.
Meanwhile, and in any case, here are the complaints so far as
they have been brought to my notice.
First, grievous dissatisfaction has been caused by the appointment of section leaders without reference to the feeling of the
members of the Corps. They are disappointed, and I share their
disappointment, that they were not in any way consulted as to the
appointment. The leaders appointed may or may not be desirable
persons, and I hardly know any of them, but I think that the efficient
and smooth working of the Corps demands the appointments of
officers who are likely to be popular with its members. I, therefore,
venture to suggest that the appointments already made may be recalled, and that the members of the Corps may be invited to elect section leaders and other officers whose appointment would depend
entirely upon you, and in the event of your not approving of the
choice made by the members, that they should elect others in the
place of those rejected by you.
The other complaints are of minor importance. The blankets
supplied are not considered enough, nor of sufficient length. The
quantity, as also the kind of rations, requires revision. There are still
some other matters with which I will not burden this note, which is, I
fear, too long as it is.
I remain,
Yours sincerely,

[LONDON,

October 13, 1914]
This meeting of the Indian Volunteers of the Indian Field
Ambulance Training Corps hereby places on record its deep sense of
regret in connection with the appointment of corporals without
reference to the wishes of the members of the Corps and expresses
further regret that the Commanding Officer has not seen his way to
comply with the reasonable request of the Chairman of the Corps
suggesting that the appointments already made may be recalled and
that members may be given an opportunity of electing during the
training period Corporals and other officers subject to confirmation
by the Commanding Officer, and respectfully resolves that, unless the
appointments above mentioned are recalled and some means adopted
of ascertaining definitely the wishes of the members of the Corps in
making fresh appointments, the members will be reluctantly obliged
to abstain from further drilling and week-end camping.

236. LETTER TO COL. R. J. BAKER
[LONDON,]

October 14, 1914
DEAR COLONEL BAKER,

I have to say with the greatest regret that Your letter in reply to
mine of yesterday’s date was a severe disappointment to me. I had
come to look upon you as a good-natured and soulful Commander
who, being free from red tape and stiffness, would carry everything
before him and that in the sweetest manner possible. But your letter
disillusions me. I made a most reasonable suggestion well knowing the
feeling of the Corps. My special vocation in life has been to smooth
over difficulties between officials and my countrymen, and I may tell
you, although I occupied no official rank in the late South African
Indian Ambulance Corps consisting of 1200 men, there never was a

This was passed at a meeting of the Corps held on October 13 and was sent

hitch between Colonel Gallwey and the Corps. 1 And though
officiallythere were even several Europeans who occupied ranks,
Colonel Gallwey and Major Baptey, who was under him, were good
enough not to take any steps without reference to me with a view to
ascert-aining the wishes of the Corps. And you may know that we
were attached to a column of 30,000, were under strictest military
discip-line, and the Corps was called upon to work at the most critical
period of the Boer War and when, in the initial stages, British arms had
suffered reverses. I assure that nothing can be further from my
thought than to undermine your proper authority or to do anything
subversive of military discipline, but if you desire to train us for that
discipline, in my opinion, there is no other way than the one I have
ventured to suggest. It will enable you to know your Corps better, and
may I say that, by accepting my humble advice, you will add to your
popularity and prestige.
We had an enthusiastic meeting of the Corps last night. There
were 53 members present. I attended though I was in agony and in
defiance of medical instructions. The subjoined resolution was carried
by 49 votes against 2 dissentients. I have asked the members present
to attend at the drilling time this afternoon. If you could possibly see
your way, in the interest of the Corps, to alter your decision, the
drilling will go on. If you could not do so, those of us who voted for
the resolution and the others who may fall in with it will be informed
of your unfavourable decision and will therefore respectfully withdraw.
I hope that you will reconsider your decision and avoid what
would undoubtedly be a catastrophe. I assure you that I am most
anxious to please you as our Commanding Officer, but I am equally
anxious to serve my countrymen many of whom have joined this
movement upon my advice.
Mr. Gandevia who has kindly offered to take this letter to you
will await your reply.
I remain,
Yours sincerely,

237. LETTER TO C. ROBERTS
[LONDON,]

October 16, 1914
DEAR MR. ROBERTS,

An unfortunate situation has arisen in connection with the
Indian Field Ambulance Training Corps which may disrupt it if it is
not handled in the right spirit.
Last week, Colonel Baker appointed section commanders without reference to the wishes of the members of the Corps. There was
grave dissatisfaction and, when it was brought to my notice, I shared it.
On Tuesday morning I appealed to Colonel Baker to recall the
appointment, and appoint those whom the members of the Corps may
choose, subject to further election by them, in the event of the choice
not being accepted by Col. Baker. He, however, much to my surprise,
took up what to my mind was an untenable attitude. He thought that
any complaints that the members might have to make could only be
brought before him through the section commanders and that recall
of the appointments would be subversive of all discipline. My
committee at once called a meeting of the members of the Corps and
a resolution was adopted on Wednesday night requesting Col. Baker
to recall the appointments and to allow us to submit names for his
approval. He not only did not accede to our request but considered it
a grave breach of military discipline to have convened the meeting.
I submit that Col. Baker has grievously misunderstood his
position and that of the Corps.
I venture to think:
l.

That up to the present we are only probationers
undergoing training in ambulance work.
2.
That we have yet to sign contracts which would bind us in
the military sense.
3.
That the internal administration of the Corps should rest in
the hands of the Volunteer Committee.
4.
That our services have been accepted only as a voluntary
aid detachment and that, therefore, the full military code
can never apply to us.
I may be permitted to draw your attention to two precedents
within my knowledge. At the time of the Boer War the Indian
Ambulance Corps was 1200 strong. There was also a European
298

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

Ambulance Corps, I think much larger. We were all under Col.
Gallwey’s command. But Col. Gallwey never claimed to interfere with
the internal administration of the Corps, although we were under
military discipline. And we were not then, as the Corps is now, merely
a training body. We were in action at the most critical period of the
war. Col. Gallwey did not appoint section commanders. We appointed
our own leaders and others. As it so happened, all orders ultimately
passed through my hands. Similarly, at the time of the Zulu rebellion
in Natal, we were under Col. Sparks’ command. 1 Col. Sparks never
appointed officers of our Corps. We appointed from among ourselves
our officers and the sole responsibility for carrying out orders as to
military duty rested upon one of us. You may be aware that both
Corps found honourable mention in dispatches. There may be
precedents to the contrary 2 . I do not know the military code. If a
grave and punishable breach of discipline has been committed in the
calling of the meeting alluded to above, or in any other manner, I
alone must be held responsible and I shall cheerfully bear the penalty.
But if the Corps is to be held together, I cannot help feeling that the
appointments of the corporals should be recalled, the status of the
Corps exactly defined and the position of Col. Baker and my
Committee determined.
I need hardly assure you that I have addressed this
communication to you in no irresponsible manner. I know that this is
not the time for squabbles or quibbles but for solid work. I fear
however that Col. Baker’s uncompromising attitude has made it
impossible for many of us to work through him unless he can alter his
attitude. I venture to trust that you will be able to suggest a way out of
the difficulty.
I am,
Yours truly,

He preaches through his life as very few do, and he preaches the

DEAR MR. ROBERTS,

I thank you for your letter received this morning.
I am unaware of the regulations governing Red Cross
contingents, and though I think that the Indian Corps can be isolated
from the Red Cross Detachments in that it is a unique corps and is
being treated as a Red Cross Detachment only because it is the
Viceroy’s wish (no doubt for the better safety of the Corps). I shall be
prepared to advise the Committee to accept the position stated in your
letter and resume duties which have been unhappily suspended. But
before I advise the Committee, I would like an assurance that the
principle of consultation which Col. Baker will recognize is not to be
merely personal to me but that it would apply to my Committee and
that its status and existence will be recognized by Col. Baker and that
the principle of consultation is to be applied to all matters affecting

circulars, which have been issued presumably by Col. Baker inviting
Indians individually to offer their services, will no longer be issued if
my Committee resumes co-operation with him. I am sure His
Lordship will consider that the recognition I am asking for the
Committee is solely for the sake of ensuring success and efficiency.
As I am calling a meeting of the members of the Corps for
tomorrow, may I ask for a reply perhaps by express delivery. I shall
thank you if you will kindly lend me your copy of Army Regulations
referred to in your letter.

240. LETTER TO C. ROBERTS
16, T REBOVIR R OAD ,
LONDON, S. W.,

October 25, 1914
DEAR MR. ROBERTS,

I have to thank you for your prompt reply of the 23rd instant.
The correspondence between us was read to the meeting referred to in
my letter of the 22nd instant and with but two dissentients, the meeting
passed a resolution expressing deep regret over your letter under
reply and authorising me to negotiate for a settlement on the lines of
my last letter.
I fear very much that there seems to be a complete misunderstanding between the India Office and my Committee as to its functions and the relative positions of Col. Baker and the Committee. The
issue of the circular1 which was drafted by Mr. Mallet and myself, and
of which I enclose copy herewith, was simultaneous with the appointment of Col. Baker as the Commanding Officer. That circular expressly contemplates exclusive recruiting by my Committee. And up to
the time of the unfortunate rupture, recruiting has been exclusively
done by it with the knowledge of Col. Baker. It is, therefore, hardly
fair to suggest that I am now even challenging Col. Baker’s right to
1

Vide “Circular regarding Training Corps”,22-9-1914.

VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

301

recruit—a right which never belonged to him. Indeed, if I may say so,
we have a right to complain that, whilst we were trying our best to
healthe breach, circulars inviting recruits were issued by Col. Baker
and even the Students’ Department intervened and more or less
formally wrote to those who were likely to respond to Col. Baker’s
efforts. These attempts suggest that there is no intention on his part to
retain my Committee’s co-operation. It would certainly have been
more becoming, if he had waited for the result of the negotiations
carried on by me for a settlement. If, therefore, in spite of resumption
of duties by the Corps, Col. Baker were to continue recruiting, the
Corps would lose its national and voluntary character and his action
would be contrary to the circular referred to by me and the practice
based upon it. It would moreover be contrary to the spirit of your
letter of the 18th August wherein the signatories to the offer were
invited to form a committee. The least that is, in my opinion, due to
the Committee, is, in the event of a settlement, to be allowed to retain
its exclusive right to recruit.
Your letter further suggests that it would be impracticable for
Col. Baker to accept the principle of consultation with my Committee
in matters affecting the internal administration of the Corps. It has not,
I feel sure, been Col. Baker’s experience hitherto. He has not, for
instance, found it impracticable to seek and value the co-operation
and advice of the Committee rendered through me as to the method
of managing the Commissariat, the way of dealing with the difficult
question of different sections wanting different foods as also of
dealing with the equally difficult question of uniforms. It is, not
suggested by me that upon matters of rendering service and doing
work my Committee might be consulted. I am well aware of the fact
that, in the forms of contract voluntarily signed by us, we have
undertaken to obey all lawful commands of our commanding officer.
But we have not undertaken to subscribe to the exercise by that officer
of functions that we have all along understood do not belong to him. I
may be allowed to state that I have before now known how to obey
and I hope that, if it becomes my good fortune to serve during this
crisis in any capacity whatsoever for which I may be fitted, I shall not
be wanting. And I think I may say the same of my fellow-workers.
Throughout this unfortunate affair, their one desire has been to fulfil
the letter as also the spirit of the contract forms signed by them.
I have already written at much greater length than I had desired

know that nothing conduces to a mutual understanding so much as
personal conversation, may I avail myself of your offer to visit me
again when necessary. I am under strict medical orders not to leave

241. LETTER TO MAGANLAL GANDHI
LONDON,

Kartak Sud 7, 1971 [October 25, 1914]
CHI. MAGANLAL,

I have not been able to write to you lately.
Being better today, I have sat down to write. I am still confined
to bed and shall be so, it seems, for another ten days at least. This time
the pain was extreme and the reason for it, in my opinion, was that I
listened to doctor friends. Pressed by everyone, I agreed to take things
against which I had not taken an inviolable pledge. I ate dal, rice, and
vegetables for four days. The pain went on increasing all these days,
instead of subsiding as expected. On the fifth day, I took salt. The
pain on that day was unbearable. On the sixth day, I gave up the
doctors and went back to my own remedies. The pain vanished
entirely and the piles also disappeared. The pain returned, however,
thanks to my own foolishness. On the day I ate salt there was blood in
my cough, for the first time in my life. I still get it. And so Mr.
Kallenbach brought a white doctor, a vegetarian whom I know. He
said that there was no need for salt, but pointed to the need for roots
and tubers. He suggested, moreover, that the body having grown
extremely weak through fasting, I should not take oil, nuts, etc., for
the present. Hence I live at present on barley water, eight ounces of
fresh fruit, and eight ounces of soup of turnip, carrot, potato and
cabbage mixed. The body is extremely emaciated. I do not have full
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

faith even in this treatment. Since, however, I have not myself hit upon
the key to my health, I am trying out this experiment. The pain has
stopped. Blood continues to come up while coughing. I have lost all
taste for food and hence this is an excellent opportunity for mastering
the palate. The doctor has stopped lemon as well, so that, in the
absence of oil, the soup of turnip, carrot and cabbage is not very
inviting, but I take it with relish. In the beginning, barley water did not
taste nice. But now I think I can stand it. I write all this in detail toyou,
but there is no need to worry. I hope I will be all right, and that too, I
still feel, with fruits. It is yet to be seen whether this is borne out by
experience. Friends insist that I should take milk, but I have flatly
refused to do so. I have told them that I have vowed not to consume it
and would not therefore have it even if I should die without it.
Ba’s stamina is wonderful. She is coming to have more faith in
my remedies.
I have had to start a satyagraha here against the India Office,
details of which I will give in my next letter.1
Follow all the ideals of Phoenix even at the cost of extreme
suffering. Tell me in detail how everybody is keeping and what has
been the effect of the environment on the minds of the children after
going there.

I am in no condition to write a long letter to you. I am still
confined to bed and I fear I will have to stay there. There is no
danger, however.
There is nothing else to do but to let Mr. Polak draw whatever
he wants. You can discuss the matter with him. I can think of no
advice to give you from here on this matter. I have already written 1
about Lakshmi. I cannot say how long I shall have to stay.

[ LONDON],

November 4, 1914
TO
THE EDITOR

INDIA
[LONDON]
SIR,

There were at the Netley Hospital last Sunday nearly 470 Indian
wounded soldiers. Many more are expected to arrive shortly, if they
are not there already. The need for Indian Volunteer orderlies is
greater than ever. Nearly 70 members of the local Indian corps are
already serving as nurses there. Leaving aside the medical members of
the corps, there are now very few left to answer the further call when it
comes.
May I, therefore, trespass upon the hospitality of your columns
to appeal to the Indian young men residing in the United Kingdom to
enlist without delay? In my humble opinion, it ought to be our proud
privilege to nurse the Indian soldiers back to health. Colonel Baker’s
cry is for more orderlies. And in order to make up the requisite
number, as also to encourage our young men, several elderly Indians
occupying a high position have gone or are going to Netley as
orderlies. Among them arc Mr. M. A. Turk had, a former vicepresident of the Rajkumar College in Kathiawar; Mr. J. M. Parikh,
barrister-at-law; and Lieutenant-Colonel Kanta Prasad, of the Indian
Medical Service (retired), who has served in five campaigns.
I hope that the example set by these gentlemen will inspire
others with alike zeal, and that many Indians who can at all afford to
do so will be equal to the emergency that has arisen. Those who desire
to enlist can do so at the Indian Volunteers Committee’s rooms at 16,
Trebovir Road, near Earl’s Court, at any time during working hours.

[LONDON,]

November 4, 1914
There were at the Netley Hospital last Sunday nearly 470 Indian
wounded soldiers. Many more are expected to arrive shortly, if they
are not there already. Nearly all the available members of the Indian
Volunteers Corps are working either as nurses or as orderlies at
Netley.
The cry is for more orderlies.
The Committee thinks that it should be considered a proud
privilege by us to be able to nurse our own wounded countrymen.
Atleast two hundred more recruits will be required in order to cope
with the work that lies before us. The service will be required for no
more than three months. Students, therefore, will not be called upon to
sacrifice more than three months of their time after being enlisted.
Several of our elderly countrymen have gone to Netley as
orderlies. Mr. M. A. Turkhad, ex-Vice-President, Rajkumar College,
Kathiawar, Mr. J. M. Parikh, Barrister-at-Law, and Lieut. Col. Kanta
Prasad, I.M.S., (retired), who has served in five different campaigns
before, are now working as orderlies at Netley.

I have your letter.
It does not seem proper that I should write to Mr. Polak from
here. Mr. West and you may do what seems best. However, if you
insist on my writing, I will. Send me the accounts subsequent to the
point where Maganlal left off, so that, in due course, I may publish
them in Bombay. Mr. Gokhale has been able to do nothing about the
accounts. He has told me not to publish them till I have met the
Committee.
I shall have to stay here for at least three months more—how
much longer, is yet to be seen. I have sent another offer 2 , a copy of
which will be sent to you by Mr. Polak. You will see from it that I wish
to include South Africa and our group3 in India.
I am not quite well yet, but not confined to bed either. I take

It does not seem likely that I shall go to France. I may have

take out a pass. He suffers no inconvenience, though.
I am sending Chi. Maganlal’s letters with this. I have already

nothing after that. I hope to be able to write if I keep well. Miss Smith1

This is no time to write long letters. My health is improving. If I
am better next week, I will give you more details. Do not worry about
me. I expect to improve. I have been out of bed these three days.
I have had a letter from Mr. Maganbhai I have sent a reply 1 .
Read it and act upon it. . . .2 Send for money from Phoenix, if
necessary. Mr. Sorabji has gone to the Hospital which has some of our
wounded troops. Seventy more from among us have gone to him. I
could not go on account of my ill-health. I hope to be able to send
some papers along with this.
The satyagraha started here has succeeded. Mysterious are the
ways of Providence.
Ba keeps good health. Mr. Kallenbach is staying with me.
I am trying to bring you all here, in case I have to stay here for
long. I hope to send a copy of the letter3 I have written to Mr. Roberts.
No one should be upset over that letter, nor build any hopes on it. If
you do not receive a cable 4 from me before this letter, you may
understand that nothing has come of my offer.
Tell all of them that I am unable to write a separate letter to each
of them.
There has been no letter at all from Jamnadas. Let them not
think that because I do not write to them, they too need not write to
me.
Please let me know what your food expenses come to there. If
you do not have to come here, I believe, so far as I can see today, I
shall be free from here within about three months. But nothing is
certain. Nothing can be said definitely before I leave this and actually
reach there.

Kartak Vad 10/11 [November 13/14, 1914]
CHI . MAGANLAL,

I did get the letters which Manilal and you wrote from Delhi.
The mails have been very irregular, so that letters arrive on no fixed
days.
You are all getting plenty of experience. Stay in Santiniketan so
as to be helpful and give them no cause to be displeased. Perhaps, you
may find it more convenient to get from elsewhere any articles of
food you cannot do without. From here I can make no suggestions.
After due consideration, do whatever is necessary. Be quick in
teaching Hindi to the Tamil children, otherwise they will be ill at
ease.Pick up a little Bengali, as you are staying there. It will not take
much time to learn it. Find out a Tamilian, if available. It would be
good if Dr. Mehta spares Mr. Rajangam. Many unforeseen
responsibilities have devolved on you. I should like you to come out
successful.
Mr. Sorabji and others have already gone down to nurse the
wounded. I could not go on account of my ill-health. I am trying
hard now, but difficulties crop up.
Make yourself useful to the Poet 1 , Mr. Andrews and Mr.
Pearson. See that everyone shows respect to the elders. You should all
rise earlier than the residents there.
Write to me regularly. Please let me know how much
expenditure was incurred per head on account of food in Bombay.

You must be married now. May your life be pure. I pray that all
the hopes you have cherished be fulfilled. Remain firm and he always
devoted to what you think is your duty. Given patience and faith,
everything will come off all right. Keep writing to me at length. Do
not look for long letters from me at present. I keep good health. It is
improving now, though there is considerable weakness. It is with my
own treatment that I am recovering. At home, we have kept up the
Indian style in everything. We take meals sitting on the floor and
likewise make our beds too on the floor. Whatever cooking is
necessary, we do ourselves. Mr. Kallenbach is with us. I keep on our
own dress when I see anyone. When going out, I have to put on the
English dress.
I see that I shall be detained here for at least three months more.
Sorabji and others have gone to attend to the wounded and are
already busy. There is a possibility of my going next week.
Give my humblest greetings to the respected Khushalbhai and
Devbhabhi, as also to Raliatbehn and Gangabhabhi, and tell them that
I am getting impatient to see them. Give me all the news.

252. LETTER TO PRAGJI DESAI
LONDON,

Kartak Vad 12 [November 15, 1914] 1
DEAR PRAGJI,

I have your letter. I can well understand that you have doubts. I
think I have sent 2 to someone the replies to your questions. All the
same, I shall try to answer them again. A satyagrahi cannot support
war directly or indirectly. There are no two opinions about that. I am
not such a perfect satyagrahi. I am trying to be one. Meanwhile, one
should go as far as one can. Soon after I landed here, the War started.
I spent some days thinking out my duty. It seemed to me that to go
on living in England, keeping my thoughts to myself, also amounted
to taking part in the War. It was obvious to me that, if this island were
not protected by the Navy, the people would starve and they would all
fall into the hands of Germans. I am being protected, therefore, by
that Navy, which means that I was indirectly supporting the War. As a
satyagrahi, it was my duty to go away to a spot where I would not
need such protection and could do without the food so procured.
Such a place would be the mountains here. There, one is not under
any protection. If the Germans took me away, I should not mind. I
must subsist on whatever fruit or grass or leaves grew on the
mountains. This food is not protected by the Navy. I am not, however,
ready for this manner of living. I could not summon the necessary
courage. It is for cultivating such courage that I am going to India,
where the circumstances are favourable. They are not so here, and to
create them here one must have an atman a hundred thousand times
stronger than mine. What is my next duty, then? Brothers, husbands
and sons have gone, rightly or wrongly, to get themselves killed,
leaving behind weeping sisters, wives and mothers. Thousands have
already been killed. And am I, doing nothing, to continue enjoying
myself, eating my food? The Gita says that he who eats without
performing yajna3 is a thief. In the present situation here sacrifice
meant, and means, self-sacrifice. I saw, therefore, that I too must

perform yajna. I myself could not shoot, bur could nurse the
wounded. I might even get Germans to nurse. I could nurse them
without any partisan spirit. There would be no violation of the spirit of
compassion then. And so I decided to offer my services. Now, I am
not a private individual, but a public figure. I must also talk to others.
These others are out for fighting and are not opposed to war. I must
address them; an unconditional letter, which I did.1 But you must have
seen in it a sentence to the effect that we would unconditionally
undertake any work for which we were qualified. Everyone knows that
I am not fit for active service. I could not, therefore, be asked to fight.
This is the explanation for using the expression “unconditional”.
The main point, however, is whether I could even undertake to nurse
the wounded. I have explained it, therefore, at greater length. It is
possible you may even then remain unconvinced. If so, write to me
again. I shall keep writing to you in reply whenever I have time.
Gradually, you will come to see the point. It is after much deliberation
that I have taken this step. Whenever I was questioned there, I used to
reply that I could not even join in ambulance work now. You have
seen that my position is still the same. It is on a level with the idea that
I must not kill a snake. But so long as, in my cowardice, I fear a snake,
I would certainly remove it to a distance, if not kill it outright. This
also is a form of violence. If, while I am removing one, it struggles
hard, I should hold it so tight between the sticks that it might bleed,
and even be crushed to death. Even so, my statement that I ought not
to kill a snake would and must hold true. So long as I have not
developed absolute fearlessness, I cannot be a perfect satyagrahi. I am
striving incessantly to achieve it, and will continue to do so. Till I have
succeeded, do all of you save me [from doing anything wrong] and
put up with my cowardice. You should all keep struggling to make
yourselves fearless.
Let everyone there read this letter and then send it to Medh.
Afterwards, send it on, or a copy of it, to Chi. Maganlal, so that he, too,
may have some points explained.
I have written this letter in three instalments. I am so busy even
here. I commenced it last week, resumed it yesterday and finished it
today, the [Kartak vad] 12th 2 .
Further news you will get from the other letters. Sorabji is busy

253. LETTER TO A. H. WEST
LONDON, S.W.,

November 20, 1914
MY DEAR WEST,

I have your welcome letter after months. You all say that you
had not heard from me at all. That’s strange. Certainly, not a mail has
been missed by me—either I wrote myself or Sorabji for me, at least
to someone or other in Phoenix. It is evident, therefore, that my letters
have all, or some of them, miscarried.
I wish that your surmise was true and that I was working among
our wounded soldiers. Most of the members of the Corps are certainly
doing so, at Netley. When the last batch went I was bedridden. In any
case, my presence was necessary here, in order to get together the
required number of men. I was to have followed, however; but now
unheard of difficulties are being put in my way and am prevented
from going to Netley, or to any of the other hospitals where our
wounded soldiers are being received. It seems to me that I am being
prevented, because the officials immediately in charge fear that I
might make mischief. The ostensible reason given to prevent my
going is ill health. I may be quite wrong in my surmise, however. At
any rate, I have placed the whole facts before Mr. Roberts, the Under
Secretary for India—and I should know before long probably.
So you will see that I have not yet been separated either from
Mrs. Gandhi or Mr. Kallenbach. We are all now living under Mr.
Gandevia’s roof. He, as you know, is the Secretary of the Corps. He is
the proprietor of a boarding house for Indian students. He has placed
one of his best rooms at our disposal.
I envy you your gardening work. Just now my own health seems
to have been completely shattered. I feel that I hopelessly mismanaged my constitution in the fast. I was in a hurry to regain my lost
energy. I, therefore, overfed the system and overstrained the body in
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

315

compelling myself to take long strenuous walks. I was too impatient
and am paying the penalty: I can now scarcely walk with any
strenuousness without the original pain starting. The ribs seem to have
become shattered—they will not stand any strain, nor the groins. I,
therefore, am obliged largely to keep indoors and remain in bed. Of
food I can take very little—the slightest excess would upset me. In
spite of all this, I am able to attend to my work. Nor does all this
imply that I am only skin and bones. By carefulness I am able to
undo the mischief done. The mental and moral atmosphere is also a
great drawback. Everything appears so artificial, so materialistic and
immoral that one’s soul almost becomes atrophied.
I am longing to go to India and so is Mrs. Gandhi;. but a sense
of duty and—I am not sure that, on this occasion, it is a right sense of
duty that compels me to remain here.
I share your views about the War. If I had the moral strength,
however, I would certainly be the passive resister that you have
pictured in your letter.
I am glad that you all are getting on well there and that your
little ones are doing so well and add to the joys of your life. I hope
that everything there is going on peacefully.
Please remember us to all. I may not be writing any other letter
this week so that I would like you to show this to everybody.
This letter is being taken down, you will be glad to know, by an
Indian friend. After James, he is the first Indian friend I have found
capable of taking shorthand notes. He is just now staying in the same
house with me awaiting instructions to proceed to one of the hospitals
where our Indian troops are. His name is Manic Lal Chandra, and has
been in England for about four years. Mr. Chandra, from what I
understand, is a much-travelled man.
I shall try and write to Polak, but you may pass this letter on to
him lest I fail to do so.
Yours sincerely,

DEAR MR. GOKHALE,

I have your cable to which I have replied. 1 I cannot bring my
malady under control. Nor can the doctors. They would say that they
could if I followed them implicitly. This I am unable to do. I do not
want to live on any terms. Dr. Allinson, the Vegetarian doctor, considers my own treatment to be perfect in the circumstances. Dr. Mehta
has been most attentive. I listen to him wherever it is possible. I had a
serious relapse last week. I am still in bed but much better and
seemingly progressing. Pray do not be anxious about me. If I cannot
recover, I shall try to leave for India.
We all wish that in your cable you had said something about
your own health. I hope that it is much better. Anyhow you have now
surroundings you were longing for.
I remain,

Bengalee whilst I was confined to my room. I think that I am now in a
position to take them. Could you kindly come for say _ hour daily on
any day that may suit you? Any time between 2 to 3.30 or 5.30 to
6.30 will be suitable for me. I have a good Bengalee grammar. If you

256. LETTER TO MAGANLAL GANDHI
Magshar Vad 2 [December 4, 1914]
CHI. MAGANLAL,

I am still confined to bed. I have sat up to write a long letter to
you. I do not know when I shall finish it. Have no anxiety on my
account. I have a very sweet letter from Mr. Andrews. He says that
Gurudev also, on his part, will be very happy to have youall in
Santiniketan. He adds that your presence there willhelp to remove
whatever unhealthy caste distinctions stillremain and that, on the
whole, your visit will certainly benefit Santiniketan. It is up to you all
to see that it does. If all our Phoenix ideals are kept up, Gurudev’s
expectations are sure to befulfilled. Let everyone of you give some
service rather than ask for any. Do not forget agriculture. You must
not think that you will not be there to enjoy the benefit of the trees
you plant. Rise earlier than the others do. Do your own cooking, of
course, but also undertake cooking for the whole establishment, if you
can. Out of respect for Gurudev and by way of inducement to you all,
I have started study of Bengali in my bed. I have completed Mrs.
Murat’s grammar and the Bengali primer. This is the fifth day. I
started the study on Monday. Today is Friday. I see that it is easy for
a Gujarati to learn Bengali. Everyone of you should pick it up. The
alphabet, too, is simple. Study of Gujarati and Tamil should also
continue. Sanskrit, of course, you must be doing.
Your boarding expenses are to be borne by Gurudev. Approach
Rajangam through the Doctor for his help in Tamil. The latter says
that his sons are there. You must be in correspondence with him.
Sendfor Maganbhai’s son. More later. This letter is meant for all. Ba
is pining to see you all. Her nursing is incomparable.
Blessings from

257. LETTER TO MAGANLAL GANDHI
[LONDON,]

Magshar Vad 8 [December 10, 1914]
CHI. MAGANLAL,

I got the letters from all of you. In my present helpless
condition, I do not write to everyone. Hence, take this letter as meant
for all and, on your part, all of you continue to write to me.
You say you would ask me for permission for whey after I
return. But I give it straight from here. After observing the conditions
there, make any exceptions that you find necessary. Do not wait to
consult me. Only, in all that you do, remember the need for
self-discipline.
You are right in concluding that agriculture is the only real
prayer and service. It is not only fitting but it is actually one’s duty to
keep repeating God’s name, whether we are busy in the fields or
having our meal, whether playing or wandering aimlessly, during a
bath or at any other hour. One who wants to lose himself in Rama,
who is striving to do so, requires no particular hour; all the same, it is
necessary to have some kind of a rule for the young. And so the time
not meant for work in the fields should be specially appointed for
prayers, that is, just before daybreak, when it is still dark. The shastras
lay down that sandhya 1 , etc., should be performed before dawn. The
evening hour that we have set apart is the right one.
Intensify your interest in agriculture. Plant fruit-trees.
Send for wheat from Bombay. Use the indigenous grinding stones.
Make copra or ground-nut oil at home. You will get both milk and
ghee by crushing fresh cocoanut kernel to a fine paste and straining it
through a piece of cloth. It seems this is very beneficial. Since it is
certain that you will be there for quite some time, there is nothing
wrong in stocking the necessary articles. Wheat must be available in
Calcutta. It seems they do not use tamarind there.
I have written a letter2 to Mr. Pearson, which I think he will show
you. It will be an excellent thing if the elders among you undertake to
do some service for every teacher.
As for the expenditure on all of you, that on Kuppu’s and

Naidoo’s sons and for Maganbhai will be met from the Satyagraha
Fund. For you, Manilal and others, I shall make some arrangement.
The money for Sivapujan, Shanti and Navin is to be provided by the
respective parents. The expenses for Chhotam are to be met from the
Satyagraha Fund.
From what Mr. Andrews wrote, it appeared that Gurudev would
bear the expenses. But you need not discuss the question. Let him, if
he does; if not, it should not matter.
Make everything you can with your own hands. Get used to
doing without the things which you cannot make.
If only we learn to maintain ourselves by agriculture and
manual labour, there will be nothing more for us to earn or learn.
That is what I too must learn. I may, however, pass away without doing
so. Let that not happen to you.
If Gurudev is likely to be put to inconvenience and if there is
not enough room there, ask him to let you live in a tent or make some
other arrangements.
Personally, I have always felt, and it now appears that there is no
institution today in the world to excel Phoenix in its ideals or its way
of life. If there is any, the civilized world has not heard of it. I am
happy that all of you have the same impression. While I am yet to
recover, Ba has had an acute attack of menorrhagia since yesterday. I
do not know what God has willed. Ba is confined to bed and so I have
forced myself to get up. Let none of you be anxious, however.
Since my diet was deficient in organic salts, Dr. Allinson 1 has
advised me to take roots and tubers and leafy vegetables. And so, even
in this dangerous condition, I am making experiments. My diet is as
follows: In the morning, I have soup with two or three tea-spoonfuls
of dry banana brought from there2 and ground-nut, with tomatoes and
a spoonful of oil added. At noon, I take a small carrot and one half of
a small raw turnip, with eight biscuits, made of wheat or banana flour,
boiled. Sometimes, in place of carrot and turnip, I take two leaves of
cabbage, crushed. In the evening, two spoonfuls of rice, boiled, with
vegetables as above or dry figs, soaked in water, with a small piece of
bread made of banana flour or wheat. This is the routine at present.

The intention is to replace cooked items with uncooked articles and
wheat by nuts. I take two apples in the morning. I have been taking
raw vegetables for nearly a month now. I have observed no harm from
this at any rate. You used to say that vegetables could be eaten raw,
but I would not believe it. I find many persons here eating vegetables
raw. The practice has many implications. I cannot write about them,
however. Later, I may. I have taken a final vow here not to have milk
and ghee. Doctors were very insistent, and I feared I might give in if I
did not take a solemn vow. Hereafter, I will never consume these
things in this present life. I will take other vows when I am there,
though I cannot be sure that I will not take some here meanwhile,
occasion arising.

[CHI. CHHAGANLAL,]

I have established very good relations with Mr. Charles Roberts.
Also with his wife. He took great care of me during my illness.
Write a letter of condolence on the death of Miss Smith’s
mother, on your behalf as well as on behalf of the press. When writing
for the press, consult Mr. West. That lady has been giving us excellent
help. Perhaps Mr. Sorabji will ask that his wife be sent to England. If
so, pay her up to £100 for the fare. She will ask for it.
Send me immediately the bank balance, the Satyagraha [Fund]
balance and the accounts of whatever remained after the withdrawal
by Maganlal. It will not be possible now to publish the accounts in
India. We are not to blame for the delay.
If I keep well, I will start writing for Indian Opinion. It is necessary to ask the parents of Shanti, Sivapujan and Navin for money to

know, so that the amount may be debited to the Satyagraha Fund.
There are also outstanding dues on account of Shanti. Remind Chi.
Jayashanker about this. Let me know the total amount I received by
way of purses and the names. Indicate also which of the amounts
belong to the Emergency Fund. I have not yet told you that the funds
of the Transvaal [British] Indian Association have been handed over
to me. The transfer deed is with me. Credit the amount to my account
and debit it to the Association’s. Include this amount too under
“purse”. I think the purse amounts will have to be used to run the
institution in India. The expenses for persons other than the satyagrahi boys cannot be met from the Satyagraha Fund. I shall, however,
be in a better position to judge after I reach India.

260. INTERVIEW TO REUTER1
LONDON,

December 18, 1914
In the course of an interview with Reuter, the Indian leader emphasised that the
settlement made in South Africa was a most happy thing for the Indians, who were
rallying to the Government in the time of the great crisis. He had he said, the most
pleasant recollections of his last interviews with General Botha and General Smuts.
Mr. Gandhi paid a tribute to the Union Government for taking into account
Indian feelings, even in small matters and he was glad to be able to announce this in
India. . . .

Indian Opinion, 23-12-1914

261. SPEECH AT LONDON FAREWELL2
[December 18, 1914]
Mr. Gandhi, who was received with cheers, said that his wife and himself were
returning to the motherland with their work unaccomplished and with broken health,
but he wished, nevertheless, to use the language of hope. He declared, too, that
despite the dictum of two doctors, he felt that if he had been allowed to take his part
even now, the work itself would have cured his weakness! When the Ambulance Corps
was formed, it had been a matter of great joy to him that so many students and others
came forward and willingly offered their services. Men such as Colonel Kanta Prasad,
and Mr. Turkhud, and Mr. Parikh were none of them expected to do the work of
hospital orderlies at Netley, but nevertheless they had cheerfully done it. Indians had
shown themselves thereby capable of doing their duty, if they received recognition of
their rights and privileges. (Cheers.) The whole idea of the Corps arose because he
felt that there should be some outlet for the anxiety of Indians to help in the crisis
which had come upon the Empire. (Hear, hear.) He thanked Mr. Roberts for his
appreciation of the services that are being rendered. It was, he said, after prayerful
consideration as to how Indians would help in the crisis that the Corps had come into

This is an extract from a Reuter’s dispatch covering also a farewell reception
to Gandhiji and Kasturba held later in the day; vide the following item.

Gandhiji and Kasturba were given a farewell dinner at Westminster Palace
Hotel, attended among others by Charles Roberts, Sir Henry Cotton, Mr. and Mrs. J.
H. Polak and Miss F. Winterbottom. J. M. Parikh presided. After Sir Henry Cotton, J.
M. Parikh, C. Roberts and Mrs. Olive Schreiner had spoken, Gandhiji replied. The
report has been collated with a despatch from the London correspondent of Amrit
Bazar Patrika published in Indian Opinion, 27-1-1915.

being; his joy was mixed with pain because he could not do his part; he had himself
pleaded hard with Mr. Roberts that some place should be found for him but his health
had not permitted, and the doctor had been obdurate. He had not resigned from the
Corps. If in his own motherland he should be restored to strength, and hostilities
were still continuing, he intended to come back, directly the summons reached him.
(Cheers.)1 As for his work in South Africa, that had been purely a matter of duty, and
carried no merit with it, and his only aspiration on his return to his motherland was to
do his duty as he found it day by day. He had been practically an exile for 25 years,
and his friend and master, Mr. Gokhale, had warned him not to speak on Indian
questions, as India was a foreign land to him. (Laughter.) But the India of his
imagination was an India unrivalled in the world, and an India where the most
spiritual treasures were to be found, and it was his dream and hope that the connection
between India and England might be a source of spiritual comfort and uplifting to the
whole world.2 He could not conclude without expressing his warmest appreciation of
the great kindness which Lady Cecilia Roberts had shown to his wife and himself in
the illness. They had landed in England as strangers, but they had speedily fallen
among friends. There must be something good in the connection between India and
England, if it produced such unsolicited and generous kindness from English men and
women to Indians.3

We are blest with many friends, who have helped and cheered us,
and we hope and pray that we may so discharge ourselves as to
deserve the kind things that have been said and the tribute of this
gathering as well as that arranged on our arrival from South Africa.
We hope this is not a final good-bye to so many good friends.

The Amrit Bazar Patrika report quoted Gandhiji as saying here: “My hope is
to come back and if the War should last till then, I shall be ready to do my share of
service as a nursing orderly.”

The Amrit Bazar Patrika version has: “India, he felt, was the country where
the greatest spiritual treasures were to be found for the comforting and uplifting of the
whole world and all could work towards strengthening the tie between India and Great
Britain by each giving of its best to the other.”

I am thoroughly done up now but on the approach of Xmas eve
I cannot help sending you loving thoughts. Our departure was sudden
& early. We are keeping well considering the stormy weather. My
health improving I hope to resume writing for I.O. Please send to Miss
Smith a message of condolence on her mother’s death.
I have been so often prevented from reaching India that it seems
hardly real that I am sitting in a ship bound for India. And having
reached that what shall I do with myself? However, ‘Lead Kindly
Light, amid the encircling gloom, lead Thou me on.’ That thought is
my solace & may it be yours in the darkest moments.

263. LETTER TO HERMANN KALLENBACH
S. S. “ARABIA”,

December [23, 1914] 1
MY DEAR FRIEND,

This is the fifth letter I am writing to you during the voyage. The
first was written before reaching Sheerness. My last letter was written
in a gloomy mood. But somehow or other the gloom went with the
disappearance of the gateway to Europe. It is strange yet true. But
why strange! Perhaps it should be considered quite natural.
Our joint life is becoming stricter. Our menu now is for Mrs.
Gandhi a portion of the special bread, three biscuits soaked in water, 3

The source has December 3 in Gandhiji’s hand, evidently a slip as he set sail
for India on December 19, 1914. From the opening sentence in the letter, the date is

plums, a fig, two tomatoes and 3 oranges, also a spoonful of oil and 6
almonds. This twice a day. Mine was ground-nut, butter spoonful, two
biscuits, 6 plums, 2 oranges, one tomato and teaspoonful pine kernel.
This for breakfast; for the evening meal ground-nut preparation with
the other things and no biscuits but 6 walnuts. Before retiring, I shall
drink a lemon. These simple meals satisfy us both and now for me
there is no hankering. The only thing to complete our happiness
would be your presence. We always talk about you at meal times,
whatyou would be doing there at the time, how you would make the
stewards work here and how you would have insisted on some cooked
things and how you would have wanted more tomatoes and more oil
and how I would have protested against both. This return to the old
style has improved my health wonderfully though the pain in the side
has not yet left me. However, that may leave me in India. Today I
have worn somewhat to Mrs. Gandhi’s disgust, the Indian dress I used
to in South Africa. The passengers looked surprised as I appeared on
the deck but I think the surprise has passed away.
I have been more and more devoted to my Bengali studies and I
fancy I have made marked progress. Before retiring I invariably read
the Bhagavad Gita, Ramayana and sing one hymn.
We have mixed but little with the passengers. One very noted
suffragist is on board. She has become interested in us. So we talk to
her now and then.
So much of our life. But yours we left you unhappy, a lonely
calf! That cow must be wretched that leaves her calf! And yet the
leaving was the only thing possible and I think it was the best. I shall
feel very sad if you keep me without a cable even when we reach
Bombay. I dare not expect any news of you at [Aden]1 which we
reach tomorrow.
And now a personal touch before I reach India. I have been
harsh to you, apparently cruel even, rude too as you thought. But the
words came out of the purest love. If I did wrong, it was not because I
love you less but because I loved too well. I became impatient to see
you do what I thought was the right thing. Pardon me then if I hurt
you as I know I did. You made no secret of it. I did not heed it. I
hope I did right in not heeding it. Let that love keep you and me on
the path we have chosen. It is a strange path, it is difficult but not
inaccessible. With sufficient attempt we shall reach it. The glory, if we
1

want it, lies in the attempt not in the reaching. Tolstoy even said that
the goal ever receded as [one] went nearer.
Mrs. Gandhi, who is sitting by me, wants me especially to send
her love to you.
And now, may this letter be redirected to you in India. May you
have left before this reaches London. If it does reach you in London,
please give the purport of this unless you would read it to Sorabji,
Gandevia 1 and Mehta.
With love,
Ever Yours,

Wonderful is the sport of God! I have been able to leave London
unexpectedly early and in an unexpected manner. It remains to be
seen whether I reach home safe. I cannot feel that I am in India till I
have landed in Bombay. I have been disappointed many times. We are
both keeping good health, now at any rate. We are very careful. Let us
see whether I regain my former strength. We live on the food we have
brought from England. Mixing two parts banana flour and one part
wheat flour, we have made biscuits and rotis. We eat these and dry
fruit, soaked in water. Ripe fruit we obtain from the ship. Ripe
bananas are over, so they put half-ripe bananas into the oven for
ripening before giving them to us. We have brought our own stock of
groundnuts, dates, etc. We have our meals both times only in the
cabin. We have second-class tickets. There is no third-class or deck
accommodation on this ship. It is very crowded. There is no room for
moving about on the deck. I think we should reach Bombay on
January 11th or 12th.

265. LETTER TO HERMANN KALLENBACH
December 26 [1914]
MY DEAR FRIEND,

Much to our surprise there was no cable from you at Gibraltar.
The inference I drew was that there was no reply yet received. We
reach Malta tomorrow (Sunday). I hope to have a word from you
then.
The voyage has been uneventful. The pain in the ribs continues.
The weather is still cold, though the sea is calm. Our menu still
continues the same. I have taught the baker how to make our bread.
So I am making use of Allinson’s meal they have on board, thanks to
your foresight. He makes it much better than we should. I asked him
to whip the water before adding it to the flour. This aerates the bread
and makes it very light. They supply delicious oranges and now
tomatoes also. So you see we have really more than we want. Though
the temptation to take cooked food is great (the 2nd Steward has
offered to have anything specially prepared) we have hitherto resisted
it.
I do not get up early. There is no stove to warm myself at. I,
therefore, remain in bed up to 9 a.m. and keep warm. Mrs. Gandhi
does likewise.
I do fairly decent strolling on deck. The groins are still keeping
well.
For reading what time I get I devote to Bengali. I write as much
as I can in order to get a hold on the alphabet. Not much time
however can be given to study owing to the severely cold weather.
One cannot keep warm for long.
So much for ourselves. What about you, I wonder! Mrs. Gandhi
328

often misses you. It shows how people are sometimes appreciated
when they are not available.
I can only repeat the formula. Do not allow circumstances to
master you. We are made to master them. If we succumb to them, they
unman and enslave us. If we control them we ever ascend and grow
manlier. Study of Gujarati is a necessity. And do read The Light of
Asia, Bunyan, Thomas a Kempis again and again and yet again.
I take it you are giving some time to Mrs. Olive Schreiner. It
may not be amiss to give W.P. Schreiner a call. His offices are in
Victoria Street.

December 30 [1914]
MY DEAR FRIEND,

Yet no cable from you. You have made me somewhat anxious. I
am hoping against hope that I may have something from you at Port
Said this evening. For we reach that place about 9 p.m. tonight.
I have had somewhat of a setback. The piles reappeared and the
pain in the side seemed to be slightly greater than before. I attribute
the piles to the pure wheat bread I described to you. We have
therefore dropped it and we are now living purely on biscuits made
there and fruit. The piles have subsided and I am hoping that the ten
days that now remain will not cause any complications. I have found a
very decent Bengali scholar. So I am reading Bengali with him. All
the time I can get is given to Bengali only. Mrs. Gandhi too is not
well. She is just now beside me with a severe headache on. I have put
her in one of our sleeping chairs. Such are the ups and downs of life
and such the hopes and disappointments. I notice that I have lost
much in London in mental equilibrium. My mind wavers and longs
for things which I had thought it had laid aside. How we are deceived!
We fancy that we have got rid of particular desires but suddenly we

has done me no good. Instead of returning to India a man full of
health and hope, I am returning a broken-down man not knowing
what he is to do or be in India and I did not know before too. But it
was a joy not to know, now it is not a joy. The anchor of hope is not
there to buoy me up. So, my dear Lower House (the expression has
still a sweet flavour), beware of London! You are in the city of
Darkness. Let the Inner Light guide you and keep you on the narrow
and straight path. I am free of the place and yet it haunts me.
No more now.

you. I firmly believe that there is some [truth] in it. I easily experience
the presence of some great men. Now something more about diet.
At 1 o’clock. I take bananas, grapes and groundnuts. I have
enough groundnuts. When that is over, I will take almonds. The
groundnuts also seem to suit me here. Even then, I am an exception as
far as groundnuts are concerned. Rama and Mr. Kallenbach also take
groundnuts. However, for the last two days, they are taking almonds.
In the evening, we have gruel made of queni mill and some
hand-made bread without powder. Both butter and milk are added to
the gruel. Some salt is added to it and so also sugar. From today,
sugar has been removed from my diet. I take some groundnuts in the
evening also. It does not spoil the taste of my mouth. Mr. Kallenbach
keeps fine. Rama takes a glass of milk and a piece of bread in the

necessary but that can be said for sure only after special experience. I,
on my part, have not taken milk for a long time but there is no
adverse effect on me. Most of the Indians who were in the jail, had
done without milk and ghee, but they came out quite healthy. Lakhs
of poor like Thambi Naidu never get milk. The experience of such
people suggests that one can preserve one’s strength even without
milk. There may be many reasons behind the instruction to the
householder to keep a cow. One is that a householder quite frequently
uses his semen and is, therefore, advised it’s use. The late
Raychandbhai1 had written that a person who wants to observe
unadulterated brahmacharya should give up milk. It is obvious that
brahmacharya serves the purpose of milk for many. Otherwise many
a youth from Kathiwar, used to drinking milk have left this world. I
had told Dr. Mehta 2 of my opinion that all of them were lustful and
that is why they had gone. He had agreed with me. Dharamsi is no
more. What is the reason for his going? He would have drunk plenty
of milk and partaken [of food from] a number of offerings. But in a
room like a store-room, he most probably regularly played with the
body of a small innocent girl. Leading such an immoral life, eating
rotis made of mill-flour and enjoying the rich ‘malarial’ food of
Bombay, he ‘ruined’ his health and left this world. Such is the favour
shown by God to India that either demons will survive in India, or
religious persons. Persons pretending to be religious men, either
consciously or unconsciously, will not survive. Our eyes will open
only when such things happen on a large scale. Such thoughts come
to my mind quite often. All this is not for running down milk but to
help one to get rid of his attachment for milk.
I have discovered one thing. It takes a lot of time to cook queni
mill. How can we waste so much time? I have not found a reason here
to live on just dry fruits. It seems that at present we will have to keep
wheat with us.
I soaked wheat in water for about 12 hours and then roasted
them. I thought they would pop up but that did not happen. On

being roasted, wheat became hard. I added hot milk and sugar to it. It
became gruel. Chewing it took a lot of time. I, no doubt, ate it with
relish but not Rama and Mr. Kallenbach. I have had a coffee-mill
bought. In it, I ground the roasted wheat into rough powder. I
soaked the powder in a mixture of water and milk for 10 minutes
and added a pinch of salt and a spoon of butter. Mr. Kallenbach and I
ate it without sugar. Rama added some sugar to it. After that, we had
two bananas and an apple each. I think that was sufficient. Roasted
wheat can be eaten as it is. It is good if cooked the way I have
described. It also tastes good if it is roasted in ghee and jaggery. Water
should be added to it. It is also good if you eat it with cow’s milk or
tinned milk. This thing should be eaten in place of bread or roti and is
meant to save time. It is clean. It would have no worms like the flour.
It is enough if the wheat is roasted once a week. It does not require a
big stove, etc., and one can very easily prepare the best food in ten
minutes. Wheat can be sent from here if you want to prepare the food
I have described and you do not get wheat there.
Why should we indulge in such activities? Why should we
experiment with food? Where will it take us? Such thoughts come to
me quite often. Every seeker of self will have such thoughts. They
arenot worthless and in our condition, they are necessary. We are
setting up everything new. If we [do not experiment], to what things
would we cling? Our normal food is full of rituals and takes a whole
day to eat. To cling to that food, is attachment. Living on fruit is the
best. At present, however, fruit diet alone will not do. So, we have to
think of something close to fruit diet. With that aim in view, I feel like
making innocent experiments. Maybe there is some attachment in that
too. At present, I do not feel that way. Experience suggests that as we
start leading a simple life and as we become firm in our search for
self-realisation, our craving for variety in food dwindles. The
[craving] for food I had an year ago is there no more. Mr. Kallenbach
keeps on testing me. He also feels the same way. From that it appears
that I am on the right path. I had to do the same in England twenty
years ago and could thus subsist on a non-violent diet there.
Now I have written enough. This letter has been written on the
basis of the questions raised by you and Purshottamdas in your letters.
Both of you should read it. Send it to Chhaganlal if you think it
proper. If you fear that the views about food will provoke him, do not
send it to him.

For prolonging the life of Santok, it is very necessary for her to
take simple food, Kuhne’s baths and, if required, mud-packs, and
agreeable exercises. She should sleep in the open with the face
uncovered. If she feels cold, she can wrap a shawl around her head but
the face should be kept out of the cover. If the face is kept uncovered,
one will breathe through the nose only. One can manage without
water for a day but without air one cannot live even for a minute. If
the water is polluted, it can have an adverse effect on one’s health.
One can easily imagine how much worse will be the effect of polluted
air on one’s health. But we remain indifferent to things which we do
not see with our naked eye. We would touch the feet of God if we

CHI. CHHAGANLAL,

Today is Sunday. We will reach Aden in the morning. I was very
much depressed and despondent till Port Said. Whatever the reason,
but the moment I left behind the gateway to Europe, I cheered up, was
full of hope again and the joy of returning to mother country became
more intensified. Ispent the time on the Red Sea in a state of spiritual
bliss. I regularly read Tulsidas’s chaupais for spiritual company. I am
reading them with a new zest. For all I know, the Indian soil itself
might act as spiritual company for me. I have gone back to my
normal diet and Ba does not interfere. Everything seems to be going
on very well. Only time will tell whether it is transient or lasting.
Both of us were not well but now we seem to be all right. I still
have pain in the ribs but that does not make me uneasy. From today, I
have started wearing my Indian dress of the South African days. In
India, I will wear only our customary dress. Here, the dress of South
African days seems more suitable.

Though Paush Vad 3 in the year 1915, when Gandhiji returned to India from
South Africa, corresponded to January 4, a Monday, the letter was actually written the

269. INTERVIEW TO “THE BOMBAY CHRONICLE”
January 9, 1915
On January 9, 1915, the day of his arrival in Bombay from abroad, Gandhiji
was interviewed by a representative of The Bombay Chronicle.

I need hardly say that having been out of India for practically
[a] quarter of a century, and without interruption for over 13 years,
both my wife and I were exceedingly glad to see again the dear old
Motherland, and the kind and hearty reception which the public gave
us has added to the joy, and overwhelmed us. I can only hope that by
our future conduct we shall have deserved this welcome.
As the public know, I, in common with many of our
countrymen, offered my services to the authorities in connection with
the War. These services were accepted,2 and I had hoped that I should
be able to render personal service in one or other of the hospitals that
had been placed at the disposal of the wounded Indian soldiers.
Unfortunately, however, I was suffering from pleurisy, and the
Commanding Officers in charge of the various sections would not
listen to my going to any of the hospitals. Meanwhile, Mrs. Gandhi
had a relapse of an old malady, and the Under-Secretary of State for
India3 , on hearing this, immediately wrote to me saying that, after all,
my work, so far as the organisation of the corps was concerned, was
finished, and that as both of us were ill. we should at once return to

India. Hence it is that we are here before our time.
I know that the public would like something with reference to
the South African situation, and I can but repeat what I have said so
often before, that every point on which passive resistance was directed
has been completely gained, through the great assistance that was
rendered by our noble Viceroy1 and the generous public of India, led
by the Hon. Mr. Gokhale2 . I must confess that the Ministers there were
very frank, and entered into the spirit of the struggle, and, as you are
aware, General Smuts 3 , speaking during the debate on the
deportationof the leaders of the railway strike, distinguished passive
resistance from the latter and justified our position. There is now a
spirit of sympathy, and, I think a desire to consult Indian opinion
before undertaking any special legislation affecting us in South
Africa. I have, therefore, every hope for the future. Not that all the
disabilities have been removed, but the bulk of them have, and by
proper conduct on our part, and sympathetic administration on the
part of the Government, there need be no fear of a repetition of the
miseries so many of us have had to go through.
Questioned as to his future movements, Mr. Gandhi said he had come to India
to settle here, and he would not go back to Africa unless circumstances rendered it
necessary. He did not know what he would do here, but he would be at the service of
Mr. Gokhale, whom he had for years recognised as his guide and leader, and his
movements would be largely controlled and directed by him. Mr. Gandhi concluded:

For the present, as Mr. Gokhale has very properly pointed out,4
I, having been out of India for so long, have no business to form any
definite conclusions about matters essentially Indian, and that I should
pass some time here as an observer and a student. This I have
promised to do, and I hope to carry out my promise.

270. INTERVIEW TO “THE TIMES OF INDIA”
January 9, 1915
Questioned regarding the position of Indians in South Africa, he [Gandhiji]
said that it was much better than it was before the settlement, all the points to which
passive resistance was applied having been gained. He thought that on the whole the
Indian community was satisfied with the “relieving legislation” 1 that had been
passed. The future, he said, very largely depended upon the Indians themselves, as
well as on the personnel of the Ministry.

One great thing which I think has been attained is that the
Government have recognised that, in any legislation affecting the
British Indians in South Africa, Indians should be consulted and their
wishes respected as far as possible. This I think to be an advance in
the right direction. This happy result has no doubt been arrived at
owing to the valuable assistance afforded to our great and righteous
cause by H. E. Lord Hardinge and the magnificent response made
bythe Motherland under the spirited guidance of my esteemed friend,
the Hon. Mr. Gokhale.
Describing the present attitude of the Indian settlers in South Africa,
Mr. Gandhi said there was no hesitation on the part of the whole community in
offering their services to the local and Imperial Governments during the war. Though
the occasion for the acceptance of the services had not arisen, the offer was much
appreciated by the Governments. Mr. Gandhi added that on the whole the present
Ministry 2 was not unsympathetic and, as it understood Indian questions, was
probably better able to understand the Indian mind and therefore better calculated to
advance Indian interests than any other Ministry. The material position of the
Indians in the colony was not all that could be desired, but its improvement depended
upon the future commercial outlook.
Mr. Gandhi said that he intended to devote his time to study Indian problems
during the remainder of his life and he did not propose to return to the scene of his
former activities unless some unforeseen call was made upon him.

271. SPEECH AT RECEPTION, GHATKOPAR
January 11, 1915
At a reception to Mr. and Mrs. M. K.. Gandhi at Ghatkopar [Bombay] on
Monday, Mr. Gandhi was presented with an address enclosed in a silver casket, with
fetters made of gold, Rao Bahadur Vassanji Khimji presiding.
Mr. Gandhi, in acknowledging the gifts, described the silver casket and the
fetters as somewhat unsuitable to a person who had neither a roof over his head nor
locked doors to his house. Fetters, whether of gold or of iron, were the same to him,
as they were fetters after all. A function like the one they held, he said, was most
uncongenial to him, and the temptations it involved would tend to spoil a person like
him whose only thought was to serve his Motherland, irrespective of praise or blame,
with no expectation of any reward whatsoever.
The only idea behind his work was duty. He had only been able to do so far one
anna of it and he had returned to his country after all these years to try his best to do
what he could of the other 15 annas in the years that were left to him. He hoped for
nothing and wished for nothing, beyond being able to fulfil the duty that lay before
him. He entreated them all to accept whatever service he could give, and not to give
him costly presents which he could not use, and which could be put to far better uses.
He sincerely trusted that they would not misunderstand him; he was only expressing
his innermost feelings.

like Bombay, though. It looks as if it were the scum of London. I see
here all the shortcomings of London but find none of its amenities;

this is also one of the benefits of living in India. It would seem that
Lady India had resolved to exhibit nothing but the scum of London
lest we should be thrown off our balance by the amenities. I feel
suffocated by all this public honouring. I have not known a moment’s
peace. There is an endless stream of visitors. Neither they nor I gain
anything.
My health is good, on the whole, and the same is true of Ba 1 . I
am divided in my heart over three places Rajkot, Porbunder and
Bolpur. It will take more than a month before I am there2 . You do well
to stay on patiently there. A farmer should not go about from place to
place. A farmer’s son would be violating his dharma if he were to
neglect sowings that he might go and see his father. You have spread
your fragrance there; it must be that some good deeds of yours and
mine are now bearing their fruit. Mr. Andrews3 writes much in praise
of you. We are to meet before long, so I won’t write much. This letter
is meant for you all.
I think all of us should know the Hindi, Urdu, Tamil and
Bengali scripts. It would be good if the children could be taughtall
these. I gave much thought to this matter while on board the
ship.
I have made considerable progress in the study of Bengali. I
shall leave here on the 16th for Rajkot.4 I shall return before February
5, to leave for Poona immediately and from there proceed to Bolpur.
Let me know the shortest way to that place. Ask Mr. Andrews or
Mr. Pearson5 about it. I am glad that your difficulties about food are
over. I have been living entirely on fruit, subsisting mostly on
bananas, groundnuts and lime.

273. SPEECH AT PUBLIC RECEPTION, BOMBAY
January 12, 1915
A public reception was accorded by the elite of Bombay to Gandhiji and
Shrimati Kasturba Gandhi at Mount Petit, on January 12, 1915, over 600
distinguished citizens being present, including Europeans. The Hon. Sir Pherozeshah
Mehta2 , who presided, warmly welcomed the guests of the evening.
Replying to the toast, Mr. Gandhi said that he did not know that the right word
would come to him to express the feelings that had stirred within him that afternoon.
He had felt that he would be more at home in his own Motherland than he used to be in
South Africa among their own countrymen. But during the three days that they had
passed in Bombay, they had felt—and he thought he was voicing
the feelings of his wife, too—that they were much more at home among those
indentured Indians, who were the truest heroes of India. They felt that they
were indeed in strange company here in Bombay, and that reminded himof one thing
said to him by a great Englishman, namely, that duty would be merited [sic] at the
last.
In what he had done, he had done nothing beyond his duty and it remained to
be seen how far he had succeeded in doing his duty. That was not a mere lip expression
but he asked them to believe sincerely that these were his feelings. He felt all that his
elders had done for him, all that his political leaders had done for him, all that Sir
Pherozeshah Mehta had done for him and he could recall many an incident when he,
i.e., Sir Pherozeshah Mehta, had cheered him up while he was a young briefless
barrister in his disappointments. He had had the honour of receiving instruction,
guidance, and advice from many other distinguished countrymen of his own, and

would he not be ungrateful if he did not do what they told him to do? He had paid his
respects to the Grand Old Man of India—Mr. Dadabhoy Naoroji1 —that morning. His
life was an inspiration to him and in that connection he dared not leave out one name,
that of his guide—at least his political leader, the Hon. Mr. Gokhale. (Cheers.) His
life was more than an inspiration to him. Mr. Gokhale had been to him more than a
brother. He also must not omit to mention the deep debt that he owed to all his
countrymen, let alone the memory of his revered parents, who taught him to respect
them and through them the whole country. They were paying these regards to them,
who were but poor creatures, while the real heroes were the indentured labourers. He
wished to remind them of the indentured Indian that staggered him in jail. When he
met that Indian, he did not know what inspired the latter to go to jail, and what
inspired him to utter the words he did utter. He told the Indian that there was no
occasion for him to go there and that he had never advised such of his countrymen as
Harbat Singh2 to go there. But that old Indian said that he could not restrain himself
from going there when he saw his poor brothers and sisters go there for the honour of
the country. How could he leave himself out, he asked, and added that he wanted to die
there. They were alive and he was dead. That man was the hero and there were many of
his type. If he had lived and come out to India, they would not have noticed him,
perhaps he too would not have noticed him. All honour was due to the memory of
Harbat Singh.
They had also honoured Mrs. Gandhi as the wife of the great Gandhi. He had no
knowledge of the great Gandhi, but he could say that she could tell them more about
the sufferings of women who rushed with babies to jail and who had now joined the
majority than he could.
In conclusion, Mr. Gandhi appealed to them to accept the services of himself
and his wife for, he said, they had come to render such service as God would enable
them to do. They had not come to receive big entertainments like that because they
did not think they were worthy of such presents. He felt that they would only spoil
them if ever by such action a thought crossed their minds that they had done
something to deserve such a big tamasha made in their honour. He, however, thanked
them on behalf of his wife and himself most sincerely for the great honour done to
them that afternoon and he hoped to receive the blessings of the whole country in
their endeavour to serve the Motherland. Hitherto, he said, they had known nothing

would now see them in the naked light and would see their faults, and anticipating
such faults and failures, he asked them to overlook them, and with that appeal, he
said, they as humble servants would commence the service of their country. He again
thanked them most sincerely for the very great honour done to himself and his wife.

January 13, 1915
At a meeting convened by the Bombay National Union at Hirabag [Bombay]
on the 13th instant to welcome Mr. and Mrs. Gandhi, Mr. Tilak1 was present, though
no formal invitation was sent to him. The meeting was attended by about 250
persons. Mr. Tilak addressing the gathering said that they were only doing their duty
in honouring Mr. and Mrs. Gandhi, as they had fought for the honour of India in a
distant land. He said that India ought to produce more men and women of the
self-sacrificing spirit of the honoured guests, and impressed upon the audience that
this was the lesson they had to learn from the career of Mr. Gandhi.
Mr. Gandhi’s speech was colourless and formal; he expressed the gratefulness
of the Indians in South Africa to the mother country which contributed lavishly to the
fund2 for their relief during the late struggle. He said it was a pleasure to meet Mr.
Tilak in Bombay as he fully intended to pay his respects to him when he visited
Poona.
Mr. Baptista said that it did not matter whom Mr. Gandhi selected as his guru
(this refers to a remark made by Mr. Gandhi that Mr. Gokhale was his guru), so long
as he always held before him the ideals of honour and self-respect, as he had done
throughout his life. Both he and Mr. Ali Muhammad Bhimji referred to the
gallantconduct of the Indian troops in support of the cause of right in the present war.

evening of 14th January by the members of the Bombay Branch of the Society and by

Lady Jagmohandas, Mrs. Sonabai Jayker, Mrs. Bahadurjee and others. On the arrival
of Mr. and Mrs. Gandhi, Mr. Devadhar spoke on behalf of those that were assembled.

Mr. Gandhi, then, in the course of a brief speech, said that he was proud to
have seen so many men and women who helped the Servant of India Society, which
would soon be the sphere of his work. He had accepted Mr. Gokhale as his political
leader and guide and he considered those people fortunate who had the privilege of
being associated with Mr. Gokhale in their work. He would go over the country for
one year and, after studying things for himself, he would decide his line of work. In
conclusion, he thanked all the ladies and gentlemen, on his behalf as well as on
behalf of his wife, for the honour they did them.

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

Gandhiji replied as follows:
Mr. Gandhi, who spoke in Gujarati, thanked Mr. Jinnah for presiding at this
function and said that while he was in South Africa and anything was said about
Gujaratis, it was understood to have a reference to the Hindu community only and
Parsis and Mahomedans were not thought of. He was, therefore, glad to find a
Mahomedan a member of the Gurjar Sabha and the chairman of that function.
With regard to their words of praise and welcome, he was at a loss to say
anything. As he had said so often before, he and his wife had done nothing beyond
their duty. He did not wish to repeat the same thing, but he desired to say that he
considered all these good feelings and kind words as their blessings and he prayed to
God. that those blessings might enable him and his wife faithfully to serve their
country. They first intended to study all the Indian questions and then enter upon the
service of the country. He had looked upon the Hon. Mr. Gokhale as his guide and
leader and he had full confidence in him and he was sure that Mr. Gokhale would not
put him on the wrong track. He had visited His Excellency the Governor1 that
morning and while thanking him for the honour, he also mentioned the same thing
that he was absolutely confident that under the guiding spirit of the Hon. Mr. Gokhale
he would be adopting the right course.
Continuing, Mr. Gandhi said that the chairman had referred to the South
African question. He had a good deal to say on this subject and he would explain the
whole situation in the very near future to the Bombay public and through them to the
whole of India. The compromise was satisfactory and he trusted that what had
remained to be gained would be gained. The South Africans had now learnt that they
could not utterly disregard the Indians or disrespect their feelings.
With regard to the Hindu-Mahomedan question he had much to learn, but he
would always keep before his eyes his twenty-one years’ experience in South Africa
and he still remembered that one sentence uttered by Sir Syed Ahmed2 , namely, that
the Hindus and Mahomedans were the two eyes of Mother India and if one looked at
one end and the other at the other, neither would be able to see anything and that if
one was gone, the other would see to that extent only. Both the communities had to
bear this in mind in the future.
In conclusion, he thanked them for the great honour done to him and his wife.

279. SPEECH AT RAJKOT IN REPLY TO CITIZENS
ADDRESS1
January 17, 1915
I have not been keeping very fit and, during the last thirty-six
hours, my health has gone down very badly; but I have conserved my
strength as much as possible in order to be able to visit my native
town, Rajkot. Coming here, I fully realize what a loss I have suffered
in the death of Shri Kevalrambhai, whom I respected as an elder. This
is a painful thought to me. I have been laid under an obligation by
Shri Pandit who has won the affection [of the people] of this Province
by his fine qualities and who has expressed good wishes for me. I
regard it as my good fortune, moreover, that in the absence of Shri
Kavelrambhai I have been presented this address by you, a friend of
his. His Excellency the Governor told me that the spontaneous
demonstration of popular feeling towards me suggested that I was
likely to have a fruitful career. I have had today first-hand proof of
the truth of this. The daughter of my friend, Mr. Shukla2 , was the first
to put a tilak on me and garland me. I look upon this as a blessing.
The honour I have been receiving in Rajkot is beyond all bounds. In
India it has become a kind of custom to accord such excessive
honour.
Hills, they say, look pleasing from a distance; you have only
heard my praises. But we have done nothing in particular. We have
come here only as novices ready to learn. Everyone must have
observed that nowadays people work with a variety of motives. It is
extremely difficult to know what is in the heart of any individual. We
are now in India and you will find it easier to form a correct opinion
about us from what we do. The world is full of selfish men, who work
with some ulterior motive or other. But to work in this manner is like
mixing poison in milk. We have much to learn from Kathiawar and,
when we have gone through the training, you will have an opportunity
of testing us. I must tell you, however, that you will then see our
failures also; I ask of you that [even then] you should keep up,
unimpaired, the love which you have shown today. Let the rest of the

country forsake me, if it will, because of any failure of mine; if the
people of Rajkot even then overlook my shortcomings with a
generous heart I shall believe that your expression of love today was
really the result of genuine feeling. This love of yours will be put to
the test at that time. As for our achievements in South Africa, I tell
you that people of lower standing than ours did a thousand times
better work than we. An old man of 75 and a young girl of 17 both
died in jail.1 I am a barrister and it is natural, therefore, that I should
feel impelled to work. But innumerable men and women, poor souls,
gave their lives in the service of the nation, suffering the hardships of
Jail life, merely because of their faith and as a matter of duty. What
honour will you do to them? These persons, like truly heroic spirits,
sacrificed their lives. Accepting, now, this honour you have done to us
as a form of blessing, we dedicate our services to the country and
declare here that we should be thought of as good children of Rajkot
if we always show ourselves keen on doing our duty; but as unworthy
ones if we are found to be remiss. I thank you all.

280. SPEECH AT RECEPTIONS BY RAJKOT
MODH COMMUNITY
January 20, 1915
. . . In reply, Mr. Gandhi pointed out that men who entered public life had to
make their hearts hard indeed. He had lost an elder brother2 and had also had to bear
other losses. Nevertheless, when attending parties, he had to agree to being
entertained with songs, poems, etc., though he was in mourning. If he kept back his
grief in order to receive such honour, it was because he received it as a symbol of the
people’s love. People should understand the real meaning of what little he had done
and when he undertook something to serve the interests of the community or the
people at large, he would demand their help as a matter of right because of their love
for him.

If the people respond favourably at such a testing time, I shall
believe that the love you have shown towards me on this occasion is

only been following one another blindly, like so many sheep, and that
it is just the same whether an address is written on a sheet of gold or
silver, or merely on paper, none of them being of greater worth than
dust. I must admit that, when I returned to India as a barrister, the
Modh community elsewhere deserted me but that the Modh people
here at Rajkot stood by me. I would be an ungrateful man to forget
this and hence I regard the honour I have received today as a blessing.

January 22 [1915] 1
MY DEAR FRIEND,

Harilal has written to you at my instance. But I wanted to give
you a line no matter where I was. We left Rajkot this morning. We are
here at a place called Jetpur. I am writing this squatting on the
verandah of a nice isolated bungalow. Addresses have been raining on
me. I am perfectly sick of them. I doubt very much whether they will
serve any purpose. However there they are; I [am] receiving them at
the cost of my health. I am due at Poona about the 10th February.
Pleurisy has become chronic. It is not very painful but it necessitates
great care.2
So you are not free to come. There is a divine purpose in all this
forced separation.3 I am anxiously waiting for your letter. And then I
may be able to do something. My constant prayer every day is that
you may be rightly guided during your stay in London and that you
may take no new step hastily.
May I ask you in all you do to think over the past and keep
before you our joint ideals?

Shri Gandhi . . . referred to the obligation which His Highness the
Thakore Saheb had laid him under, and, being himself unworthy of the epithets
applied to him, to his search for someone in India who would be worthy of
them, to his struggle over the years, and the struggle that he wished to carry on,
to be so worthy, and said that he had tendered all this praise as an offeringto Lord
Krishna. Giving his blanket to Keshavji Sheth, he asked the Sheth to spend the
hundred rupees1 in the service of the country or for some pious purpose. Pointing out,
in conclusion, that it was brahmacharya that led to all the virtues and ensured success
in one’s tasks, he said that it was yet to be seen whether the sentiments expressed at
the moment would remain the same when the time for testing came.2

MY DEAR FRIEND,

I have your second letter. Your diary is silent as to your studies.
Do you read the Imitation of Christ1 ? Do you attend to the rosary? Do
you read Gujarati? Do you read the Song Celestial? The idea of
California frightens me. I do not want to restrain you but I would like
you not to come to any hasty decision. Do let me try to bring you out
here. You need hardly be assured that I shall leave no stone unturned
to have you here. At every turn I think of you. At times I feel glad
you are not here. For, some of the positions I pass through are most
trying. Other times I wish you were here for you would have gained
greatly from the experiences you would have passed through in
common with me.
Mrs. Gandhi has up to now remained a pure fruitarian. It is a
most wonderful thing indeed. I have found no difficulty in remaining
a fruitarian up to now. I anticipate none now.

294. FRAGMENT OF LETTER TO
MATHURADAS TRIKUMJI1
February 7, 1915
Truthfulness, brahmacharya, non-violence, non-stealing and
non-hoarding, these five rules of life are obligatory on all aspirants.
Everyone should be an aspirant. A man’s character, therefore, is tobe
built on the foundation of these disciplines. Beyond doubt, they are to
be observed by everyone in the world. Though a business man, one
must never utter or practise untruth; though married, one must remain
celibate; though keeping oneself alive, one can practise non-violence.
It is difficult to be of the world and yet not to steal (to observe the rule
of non-stealing) and not to hoard wealth or any other thing. One
must, nevertheless, keep that as an ideal to be attained and have some
limit in these respects; when the mind has begun to turn away from
these things, one may even embrace the supreme renunciation.
Everyone who observes these vows will be able to find a way out
of all perplexities.

299. REPLIES TO QUESTIONS AT POONA MEETINGS
February 11/12, 1915
Mr. Gandhi came to Poona on Monday morning . . . was garlanded at several
places during his drive through the city to the buildings of the Servants of India
Society, where he put up. On Thursday evening the Deccan Sabha met him in a
friendly gathering. The next evening he was treated to a friendly party by the
Sarvajanik Sabha in its hall. Mr. Gandhi’s conversation at both these conversazione
parties was most enjoyable and edifying. To see the living embodiment of simple life
and high thoughts was an education in itself. His unassuming demeanour and free and
hearty talk were revelations of the pure and burning spirit within. He was asked
several questions to which he gave straightforward replies.
Asked about his future plans he replied that he had not yet settled anything and
that it was not certain that he would join the Servants of India Society.
Respecting South Africa he was asked why it was that some people there still
complained that the question was not yet finally and satisfactorily determined and in
what sense he thought it finally settled. Mr. Gandhi replied by pointing out the
difference between grievances for which people were ready to sacrifice property and
life—in fact, become passive resisters—and grievances which were not felt so
acutely. There was a settlement as far as the former kind of grievances were concerned,
though there remained others such as those relating to locations and racial
distinctions on tramways and railways, towards the removal of which attempts still
1

358

Gandhiji’s eldest son
THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

must be made. But these latter, though serious, were not felt so acutely as to justify
the initiation or continuation of the Passive Resistance Movement.
Asked wherefrom exactly the pressure came upon the Union Govt.,— what
exactly as the difficulty which in a way forced that Govt. to yield, he replied that it
was the favourable European public opinion in the colony which made it possible for
the Passive Resistance Movement to succeed. He recognised the value of the
representations of the Indian Government and the Imperial Government, but he
thought all these would not have availed much, had the passive resisters not the
advantage of the sympathy of the general European public towards their cause. The
passive resisters, weak, indigent and unarmed as they were; could not have marched in
the way they did in a foreign and alien country had not the tacit sympathy of the
general population been on their side. In their march they emptied tanks of water
belonging to the Europeans with impunity and even without much remonstrance, and
that was saying much in a country where water was very deficient. Some of the white
settlers even helped the marching party with food. One of the passive resisters was
tempted to steal a blanket but he was not prosecuted by the European owner but
generously forgiven. That showed the attitude of the general public of white settlers.
The Bantoos, that is, the original settlers, were not at all hostile, but favourable, if
anything, to the Indian cause. The opposition came mainly from some Boers and the
trading and industrial classes of the European white population. The planters and the
traders—those were the strong opponents of Indian claims. The traders did not stand
competition with the Indian merchants and hawkers. The planters opposed the
Indians but they could not do without Indian labour.
Asked whether the traders and planters wanted to send Indians bag and baggage
back to India, Mr. Gandhi said that the planters wanted Indians very badly—but only
as indentured labourers. The plantations would be waste lands without Indians.
Indigenous labour was not so steady and skilful as the Indian. In fact it was the
Indians who were largely contributing to the industrial prosperity of the colony. And
Mr. Gandhi clinched his point by remarking that he had always said to the planters to
boycott Indians, if they really did not want them. That was in their hands and Indians
could not have legally complained about it. But the Indians were useful labourers and
traders and they could not be spared—that was why they were not boycotted.
Asked whether there were any temples for Hindus and mausoleums of the
Mahomedans, he said there were some but they were more or less apologies of
temples and mausoleums. He knew the priests there, and he was obviously sad when
he had to speak of their character.
Asked how people from different provinces managed to speak with each other,
he proudly referred to Hindi. As to social customs, he said that there was inter-dining
among the different sections of the Hindus, but not intermarriage.

To the question, whether the Indians there would be absorbed by the
population of their country of adoption, he had to give an emphatic “No”—thanks to
the Indian civilization. It was obvious from his manner of speech that the “so-called
western civilization” was not very highly thought of by him and that he felt a pride in
speaking of the Hindu civilization.

300. LETTER TO HERMANN KALLENBACH
February 12 [1915] 1
MY DEAR FRIEND,

I have seen your letter to Mr. Gokhale. Yours to me has not yet
reached me. The idea of California does not appeal to me. But I must
not interfere. If you think that your pecuniary position will warrant
the enterprise and that London will not make you happy, you may go.
The best thing, however, is to await Mr. Gokhale’s arrival there. You
will then discuss with him the whole thing. I feel that if you went to a
farm in England it would be better. And all this is subject to the result
of my efforts to bring you here. This effort I can only make after
reaching Bolpur. I reach there next week.
Your letter shows that you were most miserable at the time of
writing. There is no peace but from within. And this I know that any
peace brought from without is false and transient. We must all
therefore search within. Then there is no disappointment. Try, try
again and yet again.
Yes, India is still the place of spirituality that I have pictured to
myself. It has brought me unconscious peace. There is much to
criticize, much to disappoint; underneath it all there is an intense
spirituality. The basis of life is spiritual. You can therefore build
straightway. Not so anywhere else and in the same degree.
Mr. Gokhale is better than he was there but he is no more at
peace with himself here than he was there. His nature is to worry.
Your answer to Gandevia was right. You could not give
pecuniary assistance with your sensitive nature. I can quite understand
that the incident must have added to your unhappiness. My heart goes
out to you. My comfort is that I shall not leave a stone unturned to

301. SPEECH AT POONA PUBLIC MEETING
February 13, 1915
On Saturday Mr. Gandhi visited the Anath-Balikashram of Prof. Karve 2 , the
Fergusson College and the Anandashram, at all of which places he was warmly
welcomed. In the evening there was a public meeting held in the Kirloskar Theatre.
The speakers were Sirdar Nowroji Padamji, the President, Sir R. G. Bhandarker3 and
Mr. Wadia.
Mr. Gandhi made an appropriate reply in which he referred to Poona as a place
of learning, culture and noted for the spirit of self-sacrifice of its citizens—a city
which, whether he made his future ‘home’ or not, would be considered by him and his
wife as a sacred place of pilgrimage. He had, he said, rendered very little service to the
country, but what little he rendered had raised such high expectations about him that
he feared, they perhaps would be disappointed and he prayed that in case he
disappointed the people’s hopes about himself, he would be judged in a spirit of
generosity and forgiveness. He closed his speech remarking that his guide and
teacher4 had asked him to endeavour to close his lips and keep open his ears for some
time. He finished off his nice little speech with expressing thanks for the honour
done to him and hoping to be judged generously if he slipped in future.

302. SPEECH AT PRIZE DISTRIBUTION TO STUDENTS
IN BOMBAY 1
February 14, 1915
It seems India is now under the deadly sway of the Iron Age. I
have been moving about in this country for a month and seen on what
an enormous scale fraud is prevalent here. I had firmly resolved that
for twelve months I would go round everywhere, keeping my ears
open and hear everything, but address no meeting and express no
opinion on any subject. But I must advise you, students, to read these
prize-books carefully, to reflect over their real import and, keeping in
mind all the profound truths set out in them, follow the path enjoined
by religion. Whether you are a girl or a boy, you will grow up one
day and have to carry a heavy burden of worldly duties; give some
thought, therefore, to the future. Truth is revealed not only in our
scriptures but in the scriptures of other religions as well.2
It is the duty of students to assimilate whatever they have learnt.
They should have religious and moral instruction, as much of it as
they can usefully apply. They need education in such measure that it
would not become too much of a useless burden on them. I should
like to address a few words exclusively to students. Men and women
students, you will benefit from what you have learnt only to the extent
that you have assimilated it. That should be the object of this
institution too. You should ponder over the element of truth in
whatever books of religion you read. If you cling to truth, success is
yours. I would advise you, from my experience, to profit well from
your education. That will be to your advantage and to your country’s
as well.3

303. SPEECH AT KAPOL HOSTEL, BOMBAY1
[February 15, 1915]
I am not in the least surprised that you have collected
Rs. 70,000 for the Hostel, as the Kapol community is quite wealthy
and it is the duty of its richer members to provide for the education of
its poorer members and help them to employment. I thank you for
your kind words. I would not, normally, have found it possible to pay
this visit to the Hostel, but Dr. Jivraj Mehta2 had lived here and hadhad
an illustrious career and I was, therefore, keen on seeing the place. Of
him, I will say in brief that, young and patriotic that he is, I am
confident he will prove himself useful to the country in the years to
come. I am indebted to the Kapol community because Jagmohandas
Shamaldas gave me a substantial loan. When I returned as a barrister, I
was afraid he might ask for an instalment but Mr. Mulji Barbhaiya
came to my help. In conclusion, I would ask the students to speak in
their mother tongue instead of using a hotchpotch of English and
Gujarati in their speech. Finally, I should urge everyone here to work
for success, to cultivate character and to serve both one’s family and
country.

The delight I feel today I have never experienced before.
Though Rabindranath 4 , the Gurudev, is not present here, yet we feel
his presence in our hearts. I am particularly happy to find that you
have arranged for this reception in Indian style. We were received with
much pomp in Bombay, but there was nothing in it to make us happy.
For there, purely western ways were imitated. We shall proceed to our
goal in our own eastern ways and not by imitating the West, for we are
of the East. We shall grow up in the beautiful manners and customs of
India, and true to her spirit, make friends with nations having different

most stirring part is that about the companionship of the good. We
should seek the company of those who have suffered and served and
died. One such was Mr. Gokhale. He is dead, but his work is not dead,
for his spirit lives.
The masses came to know of Gokhale’s efficiency in work. All
know Gokhale’s life of action. But few know of his religious life.
Truth was the spring of all his actions.1
This was behind all his works, even his politics. This was the
reason he founded the Servants of India Society, the ideal of which
was to spiritualise the political as well as the social life of the nation.
It was fearlessness which ruled all the actions of his life. But as
he was fearless he was also thorough. One of his favourite shlokas 2
from the shastras says: Real wisdom is not to begin a thing but to see
the thing through to the end. This characteristic of thoroughness may
be seen from this incident. He once had to speak to a large audience
andhe spent three days in order to prepare a short speech
for this meeting and he asked me to write out a speech for him. I
wrote out the speech. He took it and smiled his heavenly smile,
discussed it with me and said, “Give me something better, rewrite it.”
For three days he worried over it. When the speech was given, it
thrilled the whole audience. He delivered his speeches without notes,
but he did so, because he was so thorough, that one might say he
wrote his speeches with his own blood. As he was thorough and
fearless, so he was gentle. He was human from top to toe in all his
dealings. He was sometimes impatient, but he would ask forgiveness,
coming forward with his smile, whether to a servant or a great man,
saying, “I know you will forgive me, won’t you?”
He had a great struggle during the latter days of his life, a
struggle with his conscience. He had to decide whether he should
continue to take part in a struggle at the expense of his health. His
conscience ruled every action of his life. He did not wear it on his
sleeve, he wore it in his heart. Therefore he is living still, and may we
all have the strength to carry out his last wish. His last words to those
members of the Servants of India Society who were with him were: “I
do not want any memorial or any statue. I want only that men should
love their country and serve it with their lives.” This is a message for
1

the whole of India and not only for them. It was through service that
he learnt to know his own nature and to know his country. His love
for India was truthful and therefore he wanted nothing for India
which he did not want for humanity also. It was not blind love, for his
eyes were open to her faults and failings. If we can love India in the
same way that he did, we have done well in coming to Santiniketan to
learn how to live our lives for India’s sake. Copy the zeal which he
showed in all he took up, the love that was the law of his life, the
truthfulness which guided every action and the thoroughness which
was characteristic of all his work.
Remember that our shastras teach us that these simple virtues are
the stepping stones to the higher state of life, without which all our
worship and works are useless.
I was in quest of a really truthful hero in India and I found
him in Gokhale. His love and reverence for India were truly genuine.
For serving his country, he completely eschewed all happiness and
self-interest. Even while lying on his sick-bed, his mind was occupied
in thinking about the welfare of India. A few days ago, when at night
he was under the grip of a painful ailment, he called for some
of us and began talking about the bright future of India, as envisaged
by him. Doctors repeatedly advised him to retire from work but he
would not listen to them. He said, “None but death can separate
mefrom work.” And death at last brought peaceful rest to him. May
God bless his soul!1

[February 23, 1915] 1
THE TRAFFIC MANAGER
EAST INDIAN R AILWAY
C ALCUTTA
SIR,

Mrs. Gandhi, two friends and I travelled on the 21st instant by
the 3 up mail from Burdwan to Kalyan en route for Poona. We were
holders of 3rd class tickets Nos. 7186 to 7189. Upon the
train-steaming in, I found that the 3rd class compartment was
uncomfortably crowded containing far more passengers than the
number specified on the label. However, we tried to get in. The station
clerk who was standing by prevented us from doing so. I suggested
that we would stand in the carriage as it was necessary for us to reach
Poona at the earliest possible moment. The clerk would not listen to
me. I then suggested that we should travel in an intermediate
compartment until we could find accommodation in the 3rd class
carriage. This suggestion was accepted. We got into an intermediate
carriage. The station clerk duly reported the matter to the guard who
insisted that we must pay the difference between the 3rd class and
intermediate fares as far as Jubbulpore or we should not travel by mail
train at all and go by the passenger train which was to follow. I
protested but my protest was of no avail. I had therefore no alternative
but to consent under protest to pay the difference which was taken
from me at Assansol. The excess fare ticket number was 274577.
Ipaid Rs. 19-12-0. I asked the ticket master to note on the ticket that I
paid the excess fare under protest. He disregarded my request. As I
had no desire to travel in an intermediate compartment, I and my
party were looking for an opportunity of transferring to 3rd class
compartment which we did at Mughalsarai. Here I asked the ticket
collector to mark on the excess fare ticket that I had changed to the
1

VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

3rd class compartment but he declined to do so.
I submit that, in the circumstances above mentioned, my party
should have been found seats in the 3rd class compartment, failing
that, permitted to travel intermediate without extra fare until the
pressure had been removed; in any case it was unfair to insist on
excess fare being paid as far as Jubbulpore and that as my party
actually transferred to the 3rd class compartment at Mughalsarai, there
is no warrant for the retention of the excess fare between Mughalsarai
and Jubbulpore.
I trust that the Railway Administration will direct a refund of the
full excess fare.
I have thought it to be my duty to bring this matter to your
notice, as; much for the sake of the recovery of the excess fare paid
(having operated upon public funds for my travels) as for the
principle 3rd class passengers are entitled to proper treatment. I
observed that they were roughly handled by several officials who were
rude and impatient. I have no doubt that the Administration do not
desire to see 3rd class passengers in any way roughly handled by
inconsiderate officials.1
I have the honour to be,
Sir,
Your obedient servant,

In his reply dated March 27, the Acting Divisional Traffic Manager defended
the action of the railway staff, but wrote: “As the difference in fares was correctly
realized according to rules, and there is no record at Moghulsarai of your having
travelled from that point to Jubbulpur 3rd Class, under ordinary circumstances refunds
are not granted, but I am prepared to accept your statement and will send by Postal
Money Order the difference in fares between Moghulsarai and Jubbulpur.”

MY DEAR SISTER,

What would you say of a brother who does not inquire about his
sister’s health, does not acknowledge her message of goodwill and
who does not even send a note of sympathy on her father’s death?
You will believe me when I tell you that I have not had a moment’s
rest after our landing. I thought therefore that I would write to you on
settling down somewhere. Then I heard from Mr. Gokhale just when I
left for Bolpur that you had lost your father. I said to myself then that
I would write to you on reaching Bolpur. But no sooner did I reach
Bolpur than I had to retrace my steps to visit the desolate home of the
Society.1 Oh! the pity of it. And yet my Rajya Guru died as very few
had the privilege of dying.
And now excuse me for the delay in writing to you. My
sympathies are with you in your sorrow. You have enough philosophy
in you to bear the grief that has overtaken you. Do please let me know
how you are keeping.

learnt to operate a hundred per cent Indian loom and produce cloth
on it. There will be some propriety in that. Yarn, too, it seems to me,

The man who knows in his heart of hearts that this mortal frame
is liable to perish any moment will be ever ready to meet death. That
he might be so, the householder will limit his external activities and
expand the inner and live accordingly. Following this rule, though a
householder you can limit the scope of sense-pleasures. You can
introduce even into your business some degree of holiness. Before
deciding on any course of action, you can ask yourself whether it is
essential. That way, you will also discover very easily what will be most
conducive to your highest good. All this can be explained more
clearly only in a personal discussion.
Let me know what kind of cloth you keep.

better still to learn hand-weaving at the same time. If you haven’t

315. LETTER TO HERMANN KALLENBACH
S ERVANTS OF INDIA [SOCIETY ],
P OONA ,

March 2 [1915]
MY DEAR FRIEND,

I have before me your two letters. I have not left out a single
week. But when I was physically unable to write, being engaged here,
there or elsewhere, I asked someone to write to you. I am happy, am
progressing, am strong spiritually and becoming stronger physically
but I hate the rush and the constant moving about. Yet it is necessary,
I feel. Before I settle down I have to see certain things.
I was in Bolpur last week but Mr. Gokhale’s sudden death
brought me back to Poona. What an end! He died in harness. He was
in full possession of all his faculties to the last and was working away.
I was with him the Sunday previous to his death, which took place on
the Friday following. Well, I am without a helmsman. But it is well. He
lives in the spirit and his spirit is enthroned in my heart.
I have not joined the Society. Yet I pleaded for admission but
there were differences which could not be bridged. So I am to travel
about and see tings for myself and study. This I shall do.
Meanwhile I am trying to settle the boys somewhere, possibly
near Bombay, i.e., 150 miles from it — in Ahmedabad. Maganlal is
now in Ahmedabad looking into affairs [sic]. He has risen to the
occasion fully. I retain the idea that there is something in the
atmosphere here which enables you to be easily spiritual. In spite of
the rush I am going through there is peace within. May such peace be
also yours.
I was going to concoct a letter to the Viceroy about you in
conjunction with Andrews when I was called away, as I have said
before. I hope to try again on reaching Bolpur. If I fail, I can only
advice that you should stay in London where you are. Better to put up
with the ills we have than to risk having greater ones whilst trying to
avoid what we have. No happiness obtainable from without. You may
study agriculture there. I can understand that. And is there not a better
chance of our meeting earlier if you are there than if you were
anywhere else? Surely that thought should rivet you to England. You
will be surprised that Mrs. Gandhi has developed a passion for you.
She thinks of you at every turn. She thinks that our life is incomplete

without you. This is not my favourable construction method but this is
how it is happening with her just now.
It surprises me with what tenacity she holds on to a purely
fruitarian diet and mostly uncooked. I am living on purely uncooked
fruitarian food. The meal today consisted of 3 bananas, 1, 2 small
cucumbers, 2 tomatoes and 2 ripe figs and a few green grapes. The
latter two were brought by friends only today. You will notice absence
of ground-nuts. These I omitted only today because I had a full dose
yesterday. I am always better when I have only a few ground-nuts. Of
course I am having no physical exercise worth naming. I fancy that
you too would have been satisfied with such food. I am going to take
up other salad vegetables if necessary in order to compete with the
poorest.
I think that you should ring up Lady Cecilia1 and inquire
whether she received the letters you sent. They must have missed her.
There is no other explanation. In any case the least that you owe her is
to inquire through the phone or walk over to them. I should do that
most decidedly.
Now I think I have given you enough. I shall resume the chat
next week.
Yet best to address letters c/o Servants of India Society. They
will thereby reach me more quickly wherever I am.

March 3, 1915
DEAR SIR WILLIAM1 ,

The national calamity that has befallen us has prevented me
from replying earlier to your letter.
Many caskets of the kind sent to you have been brought to
India. But the Cape Town one was, as it were, destined to go to
England. It was the last one received in South Africa just on the day
of embarkation for Southampton. Then we stayed in London and the
thought of leaving the casket in England was developed during the
time. Mr. Roberts, Mr. Kallenbach and I agreed that the best
institution where it could be housed was your own house. It will only
be a small personal tribute to one whom I have been taught to love
and regard as one of India’s best friends. The depositing of the casket
with you may serve as an effort in binding the two nations together.
May I therefore ask you kindly to keep it yourself. I am sure
that had Mr. Gokhale read your letter he would have joined me in my
request.
With respects,
I remain,
Yours sincerely,

318. SPEECH AT GOKHALE CONDOLENCE MEETING,
POONA
March 3, 1915
At a crowded meeting of the citizens of Poona held at the Kirloskar Theatre on
March 3,1915, under the presidentship of the Governor of Bombay, to condole the
recent death of Mr. G. K. Gokhale, the following resolution proposed by Gandhiji
was passed:
That the citizens of Poona in public meeting assembled place on
record the great loss the whole country, and especially Poona, has sustained in the
untimely death of the Hon. Mr. G. K. Gokhale who was the leader of the wholecountry
and who by his devotion and self-sacrifice has left a great example to his countrymen
of selfless public work. That this meeting deeply sympathises with
Mr. Gokhale’s daughters and other relatives in their grief and requests the President to
communicate this Resolution to them.1
Mr. Gandhi proposing the resolution paid an eloquent tribute to the memory of
the deceased statesman. The speaker said it would look a presumption on his part if he
were to add to the glowing tribute which H.E. Lord Willingdon had paid to the
memory of the deceased patriot. One thing he would like to mention and that was the
deep-seated religious feelings of the man from which sprang a thoroughness which
was one of his chief characteristics. He also possessed a conscience. Shortly before
his death, Mr. Gokhale was called upon to decide whether he should attend a certain
conference. After much deliberation, he decided to do so in the interests of his
country, though at a grave risk to his life.2

same time. We want to run our institution for the whole of India and
so we will beg from the entire country. From Ahmedabad, however,
we want the land and the required buildings. That will be the
foundation.
We will do without machinery as far as possible. We need not
concern ourselves whether this will lead to the stopping of the mills. It
will be no bad thing even if the millowners stop erecting additional
mills. And if indeed they do not, we will still keep to the path which
we think will make for our happiness.
You have not understood the [true] significance of
brahmacharya. Will you be unhappy if Keshu 1 were to attain
moksha2 today? If yes, how profound is your condition of moha 3 ! To
believe that procreation by good persons is conducive to the
happiness of the world seems to argue great conceit and ignorance.
Good men have no desire for worldly pursuits. They desire withdrawal
from them, that is, moksha. Those who keep them company [on the
path] are their children. Not to admit even this bespeaks a state of
utter ignorance. All this does not mean that Keshu will never marry.
His inclination will be determined by the influences under which he
grows up. Your duty is to place the highest ideal before him. It will
not matter if he falls short of it. The children of one who so falls will
be able to do good to the world. But please ponder deeply over the
difference between this position and the other, namely, that the man
who violates brahmacharya for the purpose of procreation is likely to
have good progeny. Ponder deeply over this fine distinction between
the two conditions. In one of them, we deliberately commit sin. In the
other, though knowing better, we fall through weakness. In this latter,
there is scope for rising yet. In the former, one has set one’s face
against rising. Rising is looked upon rather as falling. If, in spite of
our giving the right education to Keshu, he does marry, there will be
no harm. If he does not, he will acquire a light that will shine over all
the world, such is the strength he will gain. Parents should desire the
best for their children. The latter will then acquire what they are
capable of. There is no error in my thinking. Be sure of that. I want
you to understand my thoughts very carefully. Do not take weakness
to be strength. Do not regard moha as knowledge. Think over this

323. SPEECH AT CALCUTTA RECEPTION1
March 13, 1915
MR. CHAIRMAN AND FRIENDS,

I do not know in what terms to return my thanks to you for
giving me such a hearty welcome. You, sir (President), have blessed
me and have entrusted a charge to me also. I hope I shall have
deserved your blessing and I shall have power enough and willingness
enough to carry out the charge that you have entrusted. Calcutta
revives hallowed memories. It was in 1902 that I recognised, as I had
not recognised before, in Mr. Gokhale my political master. It was at
his feet that I learnt all that I felt I should learn. It was at his place that
I came to know Dr. P. C. Roy2 . I wondered if I should be able to see
his face during my visit and I am thankful that I have been able to do
so. You have said much which I know I do not deserve. If I can steal a
corner of your heart, what do you propose to do to Harbat Singh, who
went to jail in South Africa against the wishes of his friends and
against my wish also?
Harbat Singh, Mr. Gandhi went on to say, died in prison. How could he
describe the deed of Baliama 3 than whom a sweeter woman was not born? She
was a girl of 17. What would they give to Harbat and Baliama? If anybody deserved
anything, it was they who deserved a corner of their heart but not heroes like
himselfwho were imported from England. Whatever he was able to do or say, he learnt
in England. Harbat was uneducated, he did not know a word of English but he was the
worthiest of all. It was Baliama and not his wife who should be exalted.
Proceeding, Mr. Gandhi said it was the life of Mr. Gokhale which inspired him
and would do so throughout the work that lay before him. Mr. Gandhi was described as
one who did not break the law.4 That, Mr. Gandhi said, had only a restricted meaning.

was no bitterness. Let him take any books or clothes of mine he may
want. Hand over the key to him. He may take out anything he likes

to have been lost was found. It was withRevashankerbhai. Get it from

325. LETTER TO MAGANLAL GANDHI
[After March 14, 1915] 1
BHAISHRI 5 M2 ,

You are right in what you think about non-violence. Its
essentials are daya 3 , akrodha 4 , aman 5 , etc. Satyagraha is based on
non-violence. We saw this clearly in Calcutta and came to the
conclusion that we should include it among our vows. The thought led
to the further conclusion that we must observe all the yamas 6 and that,
if we do so by way of vows, we perceive the inner significance of
non-violence. In my talks with hundreds of men here I place the
various yamas above everything else.
7

I remembered this verse in Calcutta on this occasion and
pondered deeply over it. I am absolutely clear in my mind thatIndia’s
deliverance and ours will be achieved through the observance of these
vows.
In observing the vow of non-hoarding, the main thing to be
borne in mind is not to store up anything which we do not require.
For agriculture, we may keep bullocks, if we use them, and the
1

From the references to Calcutta and Tagore, the letter appears to have been
written after Gandhiji’s first visit to Shantiniketan and Calcutta after his arrival in
India. Gandhiji left Calcutta on March 14, 1915. In Gandhijini Sadhana it is stated
that this was written after February, 1915; however, in Mahatma Gandhijina Patro,
this letter is published as from Madras with the date Vaishakh Sud 11, which
corresponds to April 25, 1915.

This superscription in a letter addressed to Maganlal Gandhi is unsual. It is

Compassion
4
Freedom from anger
5
Freedom from the desire to be respected
6
Any great moral or religious duty or observance. The yamas are usually said
to be ten, but their names are given differently by different writers. Generally they
include truthfulness, non-violence, compassion, celibacy, etc.

“If Bharata had not been born, imbued with the ambrosia of love for Sita and
Rama, then who would have practised such self-control and strict observance,
continence, restraint and rigorous vows as scarce enter the imagination of sages?”

VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

equipment required for them. Where there is a recurring danger of
famine, we shall no doubt store food-grains. But we shall always ask
ourselves whether bullocks and food-grains are in fact needed. We are
to observe all the yamas in thought as well, so that we shall grow more
secure in them from day to day and come to think of fresh things to
renounce. Renunciation has no limit to it. The more we renounce, the
more shall we grow in the knowledge of the atman1 . If the mind
continues to move towards renunciation of the desire for hoarding
and if in practice we give up hoarding as far as it is physically possible
to do, we shall have kept the vow of non-hoarding.
The same is true about non-stealing. Non-hoarding refers to
stocking of things not needed. Non-stealing refers to the use of such
things. If I need only one shirt to cover myself with but use two, I am
guilty of stealing one from another. For, a shirt which could have
been of use to someone else does not belong to me. If five bananas
are enough to keep me going, my eating a sixth one is a form of theft.
Suppose we have a stock of 50 limes, thinking that among us all we
would need them. I need only two, but take three because there are so
many. This is theft.
Such unnecessary consumption is also a violation of the vow of
non-violence. If, with the ideal of non-stealing in view, we reduce our
consumption of things, We would grow more generous. If we do so,
actuated by the ideal of non-violence, we would grow more
compassionate. In assuring, as it were, every animal or living thing that
it need have no fear on our account, we entertain compassion —
love—for it. A man who entertains such love will not find any living
being inimical to him, not even in thought. That is the most emphatic
conclusion of the shastras and my experience as well.
The principle underlying all these vows is truth. By deceiving
oneself, one may refuse to recognize an act of stealing or hoarding as
such. Hence, by taking careful thought we can ensure at every step
that truth prevails. Whenever we are in doubt whether a particular
thing should be stored or not, the simple rule is not to store it. There is
no violation of truth in renunciation. When in doubt about the wisdom
ofspeaking, it is the duty of a man who has taken the vow of truth not
to speak.
I want all of you to take only such vows as each one feels
1

384

The Self
THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

inclined to, of his own free will. I always feel that vows are necessary.
But anyone may take them only when he himself feels the need and
take only such as he wants to.
Ramchandra may have been a man of great prowess, performed
innumerable feats and killed hundreds of thousands of monsters, but
no one would think of him today if he had not had such devoted men
as Lakshmana and Bharata to follow him. The point is, if Ramchandra
had had no more than extraordinary strength as a fighter, his
greatness would have been forgotten after a while. There have been
many brave warriors who killed monsters as he did. There has been
none among them whose fame and greatness are sung in every home.
Ramchandra possessed power of some other kind which he could
induce into Lakshmana and Bharata and in virtue of which the latter
became great men of austerities. Singing in praise of their austerities,
Tulsidasji asked who else, if Bharata had not been born and practised
austerities unattainable even by great sages, would have turned an
ignorant man like him to Rama? This is as much as to say that
Lakshmana and Bharata were the guardians of Rama’s fame, that is, of
his teaching. Moreover, austerities are not everything. For, if
Lakshmana went without food or sleep for 14 years, so did Indrajit1 .
But the latter did not know the true significance of austerities which
Lakshmana had learnt from Rama; on the contrary, he possessed a
nature which inclined him to misuse the power earned through
austerities and so came to be known merely as a monster and suffered
defeat at the hands of Lakshmana, the man of self-mastery, a lover of
God and seeker of deliverance. In the same way, however great the
ideal of Gurudev 2 , if there is no one to implement that ideal, it will
remain hidden in the profound darkness of the ages. Conversely, if
there are any to put it into practice, it will spread its light multiplied
many times over. The steps which one has to climb in order to practise
an ideal constitute tapas. One should realise, therefore, how very
necessary it is to bring tapas—discipline—into the life of children.

accommodation. There was no air space. It was a time of trial. You
would almost have died in the latrine. We had three nights of it and 3
days. Yet I am returning as a deck passenger. I am sending a complaint to the company. I understand that the steamer is one of the
oldest of the company.
Here in Rangoon it is already very hot. Dr. Mehta however has
built a nice place out in the open. It is therefore not unbearable. I
should not have come here but for Dr. Mehta. Burma for the present
at any rate is not in my line. The country is being exploited by
Indians with the assistance of the English.
We stay here about a week and return to India.
I am seeing much, observing much. I am not disappointed. I am
finding things as I had expected and I feel that you would have felt
the spiritual India, could you have come. The cities are still plague
spots. But even in the cities you meet with real men as you do there.
Harilal came to me for a time. He has again left. He has no faith
in me and my co-workers except you. He thinks that I have used my
sons for my own benefit and sacrificed them to my ambition. He did
not put it quite so badly but the purport was unmistakable. The other
boys have grown in wisdom. Harilal is now not to receive any
pecuniary help from me. I think that is the best thing I can do for
him 1 .
I shall still be travelling for a few months and seeing things.
I must describe Santiniketan to you in my next letter.
For you, I have still the same message. Have patience, find
happiness in the situation that faces you. There are others much worse
situated.

GENTLEMEN ,

With Mrs. Gandhi and five others, I was a deck passenger from
Calcutta to Rangoon per s.s. Lunka which arried here yesterday 1 . I
have been in the habit of travelling as a deck passenger now for some
time. I was surprised to find that the arrangements for deck passengers
on s.s. Lunka were the worst I have yet seen. The deck was
uncomfortably crowded. There was hardly enough sitting
accommodation for the number of passengers taken. My party could
not all fully stretch ourselves during night although several passengers
were anxious to make us comfortable. I saw many lying anyhow and
anywhere thoroughly cramped. The latrines were in a dangerously
filthy state. The floor space between the seats and the doors was used
as urinals. There seemed to be no outlet for the urine. There was
therefore always a pool of urine in front of you. The walls of the
latrines I found to be extremely dirty and sticky. The doors were
without bolts. The only bathing room I saw was used by the
passengers for urinary purposes. There was no check against
passengers spitting anywhere. The deck used by them was never
washed.
I am sure that a great company like yours do not wish to treat
their deck passengers in the manner described above. May I ask you
please to forward this letter to the proper quarters for attention? I am
likely to return to Calcutta next week and may I hope that my party
and I, in common with the other passengers, will be able to have the
ordinary sanitary comforts which a human being should have?
I remain,

very good that the work there is proceeding well. We should continue
to help in it to the best of our ability. Look after Messrs. Andrews 2
and Pearson3 very carefully. You have not given any news about Pal
Baba’s health. Maganlal shall have reached there before my arrival.
I had told Manilal to send the dried fruit immediately. You must
have received it soon after your letter.
It is extremely hot here. I am now tired of all the honour and
respect being showered on me, I do not see any meaning in it.
All the three4 of us are well.

Look after your health. Professor Balwantrai Thakore will have
arrived there or will be arriving. Look after him. Give him my regards
if he has already come, and give the necessary news.

MY DEAR FRIEND,

This is my second letter from Rangoon. Yours of the 12th

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

Here in Rangoon I go out for a long walk with Dr. Mehta. At 10 a.m.
we take the first meal. Mine and Mrs. Gandhi’s consists of uncooked
fruits and nuts. Ground-nuts are roasted. My menu today was 4
bananas, 2 tiny tomatoes, 1 tiny unripe mango chopped, 2 spoonfuls
of grated fresh coconut, 4 walnuts, perhap 2 ounces of date, groundnut meal mixed, 1 naarangi, 2 slices of wretched melon, 2 lemons and
a drink of coconut water. Much the same will be taken at 5 p.m. Dr.
Mehta joins me in the fruitarian meal. He adds milk and almonds to
the above. Both of us walk about the Town barefoot. Mrs. Gandhi
cooks unripe bananas when she can get them. I have now no desire
for cooked bananas. Hitherto, there has been no difficulty about
procuring fruits and nuts. Several young men in different parts of the
country are trying the fruitarian diet. I have asked them to let me have
results. The tutor to Dr. Mehta’s sons is trying the experiment with
me. We retire here at about 10 p.m. Elsewhere I have not been able to
do so. The pains in the ribs are still there somewhat. I notice nothing
in the groins or the right calf. I have a good appetite now and my
bowels move twice. I anticipate no difficulty about continuing the
experiment. This country seems to be peculiarly fitted for fruitarian
diet. The temptations which I feared there have not overtaken me at
all. On the contrary, living our ideals here seems to be comparatively
easier.
Dr. Mehta’s house is nice and airy. It is very simply conducted.
His life is transparent. There is no cant or hypocrisy about it. You
would have liked the life here immensely. He has a farm also which is
groaning under the weight of fruit trees that were there when he
bought it. He has introduced handlooms there.
I leave here on the 29th instant and reach Santiniketan about the
5th April.1
Now good-bye.
With love from us all,
Yours,

332. INTERVIEW AT RANGOON
[Before March 22, 1915]
A correspondent from Rangoon writes under the date March 22:
When I asked Mr. Gandhi to grant me an interview on behalf of a local paper,
he simply would not hear of it. He said he had returned from S. Africa only recently.
He had not given to the, problems of India the amount of study they required.
Therefore he could not be expected to speak on Indian affairs with any semblance of
authority. He was at present engaged in studying our problems on the late lamented
Mr. G. K. Gokhale’s advice. When his studies were over, then he would be “out for
interviews”, but not till then. But I assured him that I had no intention of asking him
his opinions about topical matters. I said I represented a Tamil paper, that I was
myself a member of the Tamil community and that I merely intended to ask him what
he thought of the Tamil community with whom he must have largely come into
contact in South Africa. On hearing this he seemed greatly relieved and without the
slightest pause, like a man who had already formed his final opinions on this subject,
he delivered a glowing eulogy on the Tamil people.
He started by saying he could quote chapter and verse for the good work
performed by them in South Africa. They were of the greatest help to him during the
passive resistance struggle. All the Indian communities were of very great help to
him, but especially the Tamil community. It was considered a shame among them for
one man not to have gone to jail at least once for the common cause. That was not
true of any other community, but that was entirely true of the Tamil. When he first
met them, he learnt to admire them. Ever afterwards he had found them better and
better. He said:

I consider I have more in common with the Tamil community
than with any other.
I asked him whether he had any ulterior purpose in visiting Burma. . . . His
answer was simple. He said:

My work lies in India.

Chaitra Sud 12 [March 28, 1915] 1
CHI. JAMNADAS,

I have your letter. About the diet, you will be able to speak of
your experience only after some time. With patience, you will see the
results. It happens that one needs glasses for the eyes, whether to buy
them or not, we shall consider by and by.
I too am surprised how the pillars came down all of a sudden. If
they were the ones which bore the invaluable inscriptions, the thing is
very much to be regretted. What you did was quite right. You had
them brought down after getting your doubts cleared, and that was but
proper. Show me this place.2
We shall know more then. I don’t think tamarind induces
weakness. An excessive quantity of food must have been taken.
Fiction means an imagined story. It is beyond doubt that the
Ramayana and the Mahabharata have less of history and more of
imagination. They are both sacred books; tens of millions of people
look upon them as more than history, and rightly. Maybe there was
no brother of Rama exactly like Bharata, but there have been such
Bharatas at any rate in India and that is why Tulsidas could conceive
one. It is to the Bharata depicted in the Ramayana that Bharatvarsha3
pays homage.
We need not make ourselves unhappy in the least if, because of
our offering satyagraha, Phoenix should turn desolate and go to
waste. In settled conditions, we should take to agriculture. When
conditions are unsettled, we may beg or labour, or starve. We should
have unshakeable faith that nothing that is done is ever done in vain.
This is a law which has no exception. If circumstances arise again, we
may resume agriculture. If not, we need not worry. Agriculture is not
the end but only a means. The end is, from the lower point of view,
service of the people and, from the higher point of view, moksha. One
of the means for achieving both is agriculture. When it hinders us

from attaining the end, we should abandon it.
The freedom that the Poet takes is wrong. We should,
however,bear with a man like him, in the hope that one day he willgive
up indulgence of the senses. For him, our company is all to the good.
We should make things as easy for him as we can. We need not apply
to others the rule we apply to the Poet. That is, we need not have the
same rule for all in such matters. Even the Poet may not cross the
bounds, however.
It is because of the respected Gokhale that we keep using the
name “ ‘Phoenix’ Institution”. He gave this name to our institution
in order that everyone, himself included, may recognize the meaning
immediately. Most of the aims of Phoenix are the aims of our
institution here. He understood the aims of Phoenix and so gave that
name. We need not keep it for ever. We will look for another name
after we have settled down somewhere.
I shall preserve the dresses and hand them over to you. But they
will be useless when I have worn them out. You will have, therefore, to
make your selection right now. They were good experiences I had in
Rangoon.

335. SPEECH AT STUDENTS’ HALL, CALCUTTA3
March 31, 1915
On Wednesday evening under the presidency of the Hon’ble Mr. Lyons 4 and
before a stupendously large gathering at the Students’ Hall, College Square,
Mr. Gandhi delivered an address, embodying advice as to the duties of young men in
view of the anarchical crimes committed by some misguided youths in this country.
Though it was the command of his guru, the late Mr. Gokhale, that
Mr. Gandhi, during his stay here keep his ears open but his mouth shut, he could not
resist the temptation of addressing the meeting. It was the opinion of the speaker as
well as his departed guru that politics should not be a sealed book to the student
community; for he saw no reason why students should not study and take part in
politics. He went the length of saying that politics should not be divorced from
religion. They would agree with him as well as their teachers, professors and
theworthy chairman that literary education was of no value, if it was not able to build
up a sound character. Could it be said that the students or the public men in this
country were entirely fearless? This question engaged the speaker’s serious attention
although he was in exile. He understood what political dacoity or political
assassination was. He had given the subject his most prayerful and careful attention
and he had come to the conclusion that some of the students of his country were fired
no doubt with zeal in their minds and with love for their motherland, but they did not
know how they should love her best. He believed that some of them resorted to

nefarious means, because they did not work in the fear of God, but in the fear of man.
He was there to tell them that if he was for sedition, he must speak out sedition and
think loudly and take the consequences. If he did so, it would clear the atmosphere of
any taint of hypocrisy. If the student, who were the hopes of India, nay perhaps of the
Empire, did not work in the fear of God, but in the fear of man, in the fear of the
authorities— the Government whether it was represented by the British or an
indigenous body —the results would prove disastrous to the country. They should
always keep their minds open regardless of what the consequence would be. The
youths who resorted to dacoities and assassinations were misguided youths with
whom they should have absolutely no connection. They should consider these
persons as enemies to themselves and to their country. But he did not for a moment
suggest that they should hate those people. The speaker was not a believer in
Government; he would not have any Government. He believed that that Government
is the best that governs the least. But whatever his personal views were, he must say
that misguided zeal that resorted to dacoities and assassinations could not be
productive of any good. These dacoities and assassinations were absolutely a foreign
growth in India. They could not take root here and could not be a permanent
institution here. History proved that assassination had done no good. The religion of
this country, the Hindu religion, was abstention from himsa, that was to say, taking
animal life. That was he believed, the guiding principle of all religions. The Hindu
religion said that even the evil-doer should not be hated. It said that nobody had any
right to kill even the evil-doer. These assassinations were a western institution and
the speaker warned his hearers against these western methods and western evils. What
had they done in the western world? If the youths imitated them and believed that they
could do the slightest good to India, they were totally mistaken. He would not discuss
what Government was best for India, whether the British Government or the
Government that existed before, though he believed that there was a great deal of
room for improvement in the British Government.
But he would advise his young friends to be fearless, sincere and be
guided by the principles of religion. If they had a programme for the country, let them
place it openly before the public. The speaker concluded the address with an appeal
to the young men present to be religious and be guided by a spirit of religion
andmorality. If they were prepared to die, the speaker was prepared to die with them.
He should1 be ready to accept their guidance. But if they wanted to terrorise the
country, he should rise against them.
The President, in the course of an eloquent speech, eulogised the address of the
evening and suggested that the young men should band themselves for the purpose of
uprooting the anarchical evil from this country. He offered a vote of thanks to Mr.

338. SPEECH AT GURUKUL, HARDWAR
April 8, 1915
An address of welcome was presented to Mr. Gandhi by the Brahmacharis of
Gurukul Kangri on 8th April when Mr. and Mrs. Gandhi visited Hardwar in connection
with the Kumbhi. Professor Mahish Charan Sinha with his band of Brahmacharis
went to receive him. Brahmachari Budhaduri read the address....
Mr. Gandhi replied:

I feel indebted to Mahatmaji for his love. I came to Hardwar
only to pay my respects to Mahatma Munshiram, as Mr. Andrews has
pointed out his name as one of the three great men whom I ought to
see in India.
He thanked the Brahmacharis for the help they sent to their Indian brothers in
Africa and felt specially grateful to the Brahmacharis and the Mahatma for the love
and affection they extended towards his Phoenix boys while visiting Gurukul and felt
that his pilgrimage to Gurukul was satisfactory. He said:

I am proud that Mahatmaji has called me his brother in a letter,
Please pray that I may deserve his fraternity. I have come after 28
years to my country. I can give no advice. I have come to seek
guidance and am ready to bow down to anyone who is devoted to the
service of the Motherland and I am ready to lay down my life in the
service of my country and I shall no more go abroad. One of my
brothers is gone.1 I want guidance. I hope the Mahatmaji will take his
place and be a brother to me now.

he would live in India and would not go abroad like others to serve India from outside.
He hoped that Mr. Gandhi would be the beacon light of India.

The Hindu, 12-4-1915

339. SPEECH AT ST. STEPHEN’S COLLEGE1
DELHI ,

April 13, 1915
Mr. Gandhi said he took the liberty of speaking in Hindi having ascertained
previously from the Principal that the European staff of the College understood the
language of the people and he was glad to know that they did.
In the course of his address he said that it would be premature for him to offer
any advice in regard to Indian problems, for he had been long away from the
motherland. He needed to learn first before he spoke. He had come to learn and hoped
to live and die in India now. Long years ago when he met his Master Mr. Gokhale, he
felt he had found his guru in the sphere of politics and he had tried humbly and
faithfully to follow him. In the religious sphere he had not met with a religious guru
yet. But he must not leave people under a false impression in this respect. His Master,
Gokhale, was a deeply religious man. Nobody worked with him in the closest contact
but felt the depth of the reality of his essential religious temper. To Mr. Gokhale God
was a great reality and truth was a great reality. This it was which explained his
incessant and indefatigable labours which tried his physical powers at last. He was a
Hindu but one of the right type. A Hindu sannyasi once came to him and made a
proposal to push the Hindu political cause in a way which would suppress the
Mahomedan and he pressed his proposal with many specious religious reasons. Mr.
Gokhale replied to this person in the following words: “If to be a Hindu I must do as
you wish me to do, please publish it abroad that I am not a Hindu.” But Mr. Gokhale
was a Hindu and his religion was fearlessness. He had a deep belief in God, in the
eternal triumph of truth. This explained his arduous toil in mastering facts and in
investigating truth. India’s greatest need was this great fear of God—the fear of God
alone and therefore no fear of man. That was the one thing we needed. Anarchism was
1

This was in reply to a welcome address by Principal Rudra. Gandhiji spoke

in Hindi.
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

399

not necessary. If it existed, it showed there was no fear of God. To face evil we must
stand in the strength of God and truth; and there was that ancient text on the College
walls that truth, not falsehood, eternally triumphed. Evil of any kind could not stand
the searching light of truth and could only be rooted out in the strength of God
through personal suffering and not through the infliction of suffering on others. That
was the secret.

Fear God, therefore, and do not fear men, and remember that
ahimsa is our religion, the great gift of our rishis. What we have got to
do is to bring this religion of the Fear of God into all our lives and
even into politics. Nothing but this and the passionate love of truthwill
help us. I would exhort you therefore to obey your teachers and to be
true to your College motto, to be rooted in the truth of it, so that you
may worthily enter the citizenship of your motherland.”
Then thanking the students for their splendid help in the South African crisis
and their hospitality and kindness to the Phoenix boys when they were the guests of
the Principal, Mr. Gandhi resumed his seat amidst loud and prolonged applause.

MY DEAR FRIEND,

I am on my way to Madras. This eternal moving is now telling
on me and I am pining for rest my post too cannot be received as no
one knows where I am. I shall get letters only at Madras now. My
experiences have been rich and varied. Some time or other I may let
you have a portion of them. This cannot be until I have settled down
somewhere. I have not yet stayed a fortnight at a stretch at any place,
not even at Rangoon.
I had hoped to meet the Viceroy at Delhi but he was not there. I
have not yet been able to hit upon any method of approaching him
about you. I fear that for the time being you will have to wait there. I
am sure that you ought not to think of going to California or any
other place. I only wish you could find some occupation to steady
you. For me there is no doubt that India has a great hold on me. Even
amid the most trying circumstances, I am able to perceive the inner
life. It may be all a delusion. But it is there.

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

At Hardwar, one of the holiest places in India, I felt the need to
take a further step and this is what I have done. In India I am not to
take for my sustenance more than five things during 24 hours and not
to eat after sunset. Things include condiments. Thus if I have taken
today, say, bananas, dates, ground-nuts, oranges and lemons, I may
not take cloves or tamarind. I still take two meals and I have to make
my choice of five things for the day. Both the vows are fairly stiff. But
they had to be taken. The spirit was there. The flesh will have to yield.
The vows were taken on the 10th instant. 1 I have left the boys at
Hardwar to work as volunteer nurses to pilgrims. With me are Mrs.
Gandhi and Dr. Mehta’s eldest brother.2 He accompanies me to curb
his temper. He is 65 years old. He has become a pure fruitarian and
avoids milk also. He is doing very well indeed.
Needless to say we have been travelling 3rd-class throughout. At
times it is most trying, involving long night journeys in crowded
compartments.

and Sorabjee.

341. SPEECH ON ARRIVAL AT MADRAS
April 17, 1915
Mr. and Mrs. M. K. Gandhi arrived in Madras last Saturday evening from
Hardwar by the Delhi Express. . . . A little disappointment was in store for the
people, however. When the train arrived, they searched all the first and second class
compartments, but in vain, and they were inclined to think that Mr. Gandhi and Mrs.
Gandhi had not come. But a guard told them that Mr. and Mrs. Gandhi had come by
that train and they were in a compartment at the end of the train. A long search
discovered Mr. and Mrs. Gandhi sitting in a third class compartment. Mr. Gandhi
looked thin and emaciated, a loose shirt soiled by four days of continuous travel
covered his body and a pair of trousers similar in appearance covered his legs. There

was a rush to that compartment and the crowd was such that about a dozen policemen
who had been there found themselves powerless to manage the crowd and had to leave
it to shift as best it could. . . .Shouts of “Long live Mr. and Mrs. Gandhi”, “Long live
our hero” and “Bande Mataram” rang from the crowd. Mr. Gandhi bowed to them in
acknowledgement and was conducted to the carriage. The students who had gathered in
large numbers unyoked the horse and volunteered to drag the carriage. The carriage
was taken, dragged by the students, to the premises of Messrs Natesan & Co.,
Sunkurama Chetty Street, Mr. Gandhi being cheered all along the way, Mr. and Mrs.
Gandhi standing in the carriage and with hands cooped [sic] acknowledging the
greetings.
On arrival at Messrs Natesan & Co., where he will be stopping during his stay
in Madras, Mr. Gandhi stood up in the carriage and in a loud and clear voice said that
he was exceedingly thankful to them for the expression of their love to him. He was
fagged on account of the four days continuous journey and wished to be allowed to say
good night. He would, however, be free to see them during his stay here between three
and five o’clock on all days and discuss questions affecting their common good.
Mr. and Mrs. Gandhi expect to stay in Madras for a fortnight. Mr. Gandhi
desires to visit the places in the South wherefrom the bulk of South African Indian
settlers have been drawn in order to meet such of the passive resisters as have settled
in India.

342. LETTER TO LAZARUS
MADRAS,

[After April 17, 1915] 1
MY DEAR LAZARUS,

I have your letter. The Indian Relief Bill2 ought to serve, as it
was designed to serve, as a sound basis on which we can erect a sound
structure. I gave ample warning on my leaving South Africa that it
might be differently interpreted by the Government. In every such
case we have our own remedy—legal and moral. We may or we may
not take up the legal remedy. The moral is, and should be, always at
our disposal, and that is passive resistance. If the spirit of the
settlement is not carried out and hardships are inflicted by the

place after returning from South Africa.

administration, our final remedy must be passive resistance. I hope
none of you considered that we would never have to resort to passive
resistance. All that one could hope for was that the Government had
altered their spirit and that they would not lightly invite a revival of
the struggle. But this last and sovereign remedy is always at our
disposal to be used whenever necessary. Of course virtue lies in
knowing when it should be used. Generally speaking, if there is a
departure from the fundamental principles which were laid down at
the time of the settlement, there is sufficient cause for offering passive
resistance. You must understand the main purpose of the Relief [Bill]
Let me reiterate the chief points. First, the removal of the £3 tax:
second, the reinstatement of the status of Indian wives: third, repeal of
the Asiatic Act. These three things have been obtained, I think,
practically for all time. Just administration of existing laws is a point
covered by the correspondence4 which was published immediately
after the passage of the Bill, and it is there that naturally there was an
uncertainty. Our meaning of just administration may be totally
different from that of the Government, and to keep the Government
up to the level of our views, there must be continuous watching.
With regard to Christopher, I note what you would want me to
do. I shall try to do what I can. I have not yet settled down. I have just
arrived in Madras in the course of my wanderings, but as soon as I
settle down I shall see what can be done. I take it that, if there is a
scholarship forthcoming, he will study in India.
As to your suggestion about Indian Opinion, its sphere is
narrow for want of workers. In spite of desperate efforts we have not
been able, as you are aware, to get a sufficiently large number of
selfless workers. I still feel that it cannot be worked upon any other
lines. Immediately we introduce the system of payment according to
ability, it will lose all its usefulness. Anyhow, that is not the Phoenix
ideal. You have to raise at least a few colonial-born young men who
would devote themselves to public cause without thought of reward,
and you can make Indian Opinion a greater power than it is and you
can then make it cater for colonial-born Indians in the special sense
you suggest.
That a sound body carries a sound mind is after all a truism, but
it is to be interpreted with many qualifications. Take the celebrated
Sandow. His is, as you would consider, one of the soundest bodies. I
am not sure that he necessarily carries a sound mind with it. To me a
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

403

sound body means one which bends itself to the spirit and is always a
ready instrument at its service. Such bodies are not made, in my
opinion, on the football field. They are made on cornfields and farms.
I would urge you to think this over and you will find innumerable
illustrations to prove my statement. Our colonial-born Indians are
carried away with this football and cricket mania. These games may
have their place under certain circumstances. But I feel sure that for
us, who are just now so fallen, they have no room. Why do we not take
the simple fact into consideration that the vast majority of mankind
who are vigorous in body and mind are simple agriculturists, that they
are strangers to these games, and they are the salt of the earth?
Without them your and my existence would be an impossibility,
whereas you and I are totally unnecessary for their well-being.
The health of both Mrs. Gandhi and myself is good. It would
have been better had we not been touring so ceaselessly as we have
done. But the holy atmosphere of India has done all that we had
expected. It is because there is something peculiar about the Indian
atmosphere that I suggest so strongly to the colonial-born friends that
they should consider it as a matter of duty to visit India, and to visit as
Indians wanting to live the purely Indian life, and not half-European
and half-Indian.
I think I have now covered all the points you have raised. Be
good to the people of Phoenix, have patience with them. They are
doing their best, they are giving their all, they mean to render services
to the motherland. Help them to do so, criticise them by all means, but
let your criticism be tempered with love of the settlement. Please
remember me to the old folks. I should not forget you or Brian from
whom I have received so much love. Whenever you are prepared to
give me your boys on my terms, I shall be ready to take them over.
The sooner you come to a decision, the better. Else it may be too late
for them.
Yours sincerely

343. SPEECH AT GOKHALE CLUB, MADRAS
April 20, 1915
Yesterday evening, Mr. Gandhi spent about an hour and a quarter in a
conversation in the home of the Servants of India Society with the members of the
Gokhale Club, an association of young men started some six months ago for the
study of pubic questions under the guidance of experienced elders.
Mr. Gandhi described his “Phoenix” settlement scheme1 as one meant for the
training of people for the service of the motherland. Special attention would be paid
in the settlement to the formation of character and several vernaculars would be taught
in it. In his opinion, the observance of brahmacharya was essential for all national
service and would be a necessary condition for admission into the settlement.
Everyone there would be taught and required to do some manual work, preferably in
connection with agriculture. The settlement would be open to persons of both sexes,
married and unmarried. Asked if he would recommend brahmacharya and poverty as
ideals to be followed by the whole country, he said he would do so without the least
hesitation; only he would recognise it as a religious impossibility for a whole nation
to follow them. For conduct in life he would recommend two principles above all—
love of truth and ahimsa , the latter including abstention from giving any pain to the
body or to the mind and extending to all forms of life. As to the application of
passive resistance to politics, he warned his hearers that it was a very difficult
weapon to use and should not be resorted to except as a last resource and in defence of
the dearest interest like national honour. He was against the use of all machinery and
would use only hand-made articles.
When the meeting dispersed, everyone present felt chastened by his inspiring
words.

[GEORGETOWN,

MADRAS]1

Vaishakh Sud 7 [April 21, 1915] 2
CHI. MAGANLAL,

I learnt from Maganbhai that you had reached Gurukula.
Agricultural work is part of satyagraha. We have deduced the
necessity of agricultural work from satyagraha. Hence the question:
what should one do if it becomes necessary to give up agricultural
work for the sake of satyagraha? My purpose was to show Jamnadas
that [in such a situation] agricultural work is not our chief object. His
question was: What should one do if the ruler of the place where we
are living seizes our land? Also, that if a situation arises in which one
may have to attend immediately to some urgent work, the agricultural
work may get neglected. I can say much to explain this matter. Our
object always remains the same. But as circumstances change from
time to time, we can deduce from the nature of our object what should
be done in each case.
If Jamnadas does not take the vows, he can remain in the
capacity of a student.
Harilal’s3 letter made me realize that 1 should act more
independently of others than I do at present and teach you all to do
likewise. You have to show to a still greater degree that you always do
what you think proper and not out of regard for me. As for Harilal’s
letter, it merely echoed his weakness. All of us shrink from admitting
our weakness, and so abuse what our weakness does not permit us to
do. Even Harilal seems to have realized this now. His two letters
accompanying this, are worth reading and pondering over by you all.
Therefore, read them and understand their meaning. Preserve the
letters. It seems to me that Manilal4 , Ramdas5 , and you too, will recover

everything for myself. I will await a detailed letter from you today.
Assuming that Maganbhai and the others will also read this

345. SPEECH AT PUBLIC RECEPTION, MADRAS2
April 21, 1915
Mr. Gandhi rose amidst deafening cheers and said:
MR. CHAIRMAN AND FRIENDS,

On behalf of my wife and myself, I am deeply grateful for the
great honour that you here and Madras, and, may I say, this
Presidency have done to us and the affection that has been lavished
upon us in this great and enlightened—not benighted—Presidency.
(“Hear, hear.”) If there is anything that we have deserved, as has been
stated in this beautiful address, I can only say I lay it at the feet of my
Master under whose inspiration I have been working all this time
under exile in South Africa. In so far as the sentiments expressed in
this address are merely prophetic, Sir, I accept them as a blessing and
as a prayer from you and from this great meeting, that both my wife
and I myself may possess the power, the inclination, and the life to
dedicate whatever we may develop in this sacred land of ours to the
service of the motherland. (Cheers.) It is no wonder that we have come
1

On April 10, 1915, at Hardwar, Gandhiji took two vows—not to eat more
than five articles of food during 24 hours and not to eat after sunset.
2
The address, presented by the Indian South African League, was read by G. A.
Natesan. Sir Subrahmania Aiyar presided. Among those present were Mrs. Besant,
Justice Tyabji, Srinivasa Sastri and others.
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

to Madras. As my friend, Mr. Natesan, will perhaps tell you, we have
been overdue and we have neglected Madras. But we have done
nothing of the kind. We knew that we had a corner in your hearts and
we knew that you will not misjudge us if we did not hasten to Madras
before going to other Presidencies and to other towns. It was in 1896
that I found in Mr. Gokhale my rajya guru (Cheers.) and it was in the
same year that I found in Madras, as I did not find in any other
place, that deep abiding sense of religion. It appeared in 1896
before you as a stranger pleading a forlorn cause. 1 I then
discovered that Madras, or this Presidency, had that instinctive power
to distinguish between a right cause and a wrong cause, and it was
here that you appreciated in its fullest measure the gravity of the
situation that I was then endeavouring to place before my
countrymenthroughout India. (“Hear, hear.”) And the impressions
that I took with me to South Africa in 1896 have been more than
amply verified throughout my experience in South Africa.The
drafters of this beautiful address have, I venture to say, exaggerated
the importance of the little work that I was able to do in South Africa
out of all proportion. (Cries of “No, no”.) As I have said on so many
platforms, India has been still suffering under the hypnotic influence
produced upon it by that great saintly politician, Mr. Gokhale.
(Cheers.) He issued in my favour a certificate which you have
taken at its surface value, and it is that certificate which has placed
me in a most embarrassing position, because I do not know that I
shall be able to answer the expectations that have been raised
about myself, and about my wife in the work that lies before us in
the future on behalf of this country. But, Sir, if one-tenth of the
language that has been used in this address is deserved by us,
what language do you propose to use for those who have lost
their lives, and therefore finished their work on behalf of your
suffering countrymen in South Africa? What language do you
propose to use for Nagappen 2 and Narayansamy 3 , lads of seventeen
or eighteen years, who braved in simple faith all the trials, all
the sufferings, and all the indignities for the sake of the honour of

the motherland? (Cheers.) What language do you propose to use with
reference to Valliamma, that sweet girl of seventeen years who was
discharged from Maritzburg prison, skin and bone, suffering from
fever to which she succumbed after about a month’s time? (Cries of
“Shame”.) It was the Madrassees who of all the Indians were singled
out by the great Divinity that rules over us for this great work. Do you
know that in the great city of Johannesburg, it is found among the
Madrassees that any Madrassee is considered dishonoured if he has
not passed through the jails once or twice during this terrible crisis
that your countrymen in South Africa went through during these
eight long years?1 You have said that I inspired these great men and
women, but I cannot accept that proposition. It was they, the simpleminded folk, who worked away in faith, never expecting the slightest
reward, who inspired me, who kept me to the proper level, and who
compelled me by their great sacrifice, by their great faith, by their
great trust in the great God to do the work that I was able to do.
(Cheers.) It is my misfortune that I and my wife have been obliged to
work in the limelight, and you have magnified out of all proportion
(Cries of “No, no”.) this little work we have been able to do. Believe
me, my dear friends that if you consider, whether in India or in South
Africa, it is possible for us, poor mortals, the same individuals, the
same stuff of which you are made, if you consider that it is possible
for us to do anything whatsoever without your assistance, and without
your doing the same thing that we would be prepared to do, you are
lost, and we are also lost, and our service will be in vain. I do not for
one moment believe that the inspiration was given by us. The
inspiration was given by them to us, and we were able to be
interpreters between the powers who called themselves the governors
and those men for whom redress was so necessary. We were simply
links between those two parties and nothing more. It was my duty,
having received the education that was given to me by my parents,
tointerpret what was going on in our midst to those simple folk, and
they rose to the occasion. They realised the importance of birth in
India, they realised the might of religious force, and it was they who
inspired us, and let them who have finished their work, and who have
died for you and me, let them inspire you and us. We are still living,
and who knows whether the devil will not possess us tomorrow and we
shall not forsake the post of duty before any new danger that may

face us? But these three have gone for ever. An old man of 75 from
the United Provinces, Harbat Singh, has also joined the majority and
died in jail in South Africa, and he deserved the crown that you would
seek to impose upon us. These young men deserve all the adjectives
that you have so affectionately, but blindly lavished upon us. It was
not only the Hindus who struggled, but there were Mahomedans,
Parsis and Christians, and almost every part of India was represented
in the struggle. They realised the common danger, and they realised
also what their destiny was as Indians, and it was they, and they alone,
who matched the soul-force against the physical forces. (Loud
applause.)
The meeting then terminated with a vote of thanks to the Chair.

[GEORGETOWN, M ADRAS]1

Vaishakh Sud 8 [April 22,1915] 2
CHI. MAGANLAL,

I got your letter today. I see from it that you are much worried
and that you have become nervous. I have not become impatient. I am
perfectly easy in mind. It is true that the condition of the country that
I see today has induced in me a still greater spirit of renunciation. But
you are in no way connected with that. I do not in the least mind if all
of you continue to be as you are today. We have been observing in
the past the vows3 that I have suggested. All that I am now asking is
that they should be observed more firmly and intelligently. But even
in that, I will expect and accept from you only what you can give. I do
not insist on anything. I wish you to shed fear. I will be able to go
there4 in about a month’s time. I will leave this place on the 7th. They
have been showing me boundless love here. About four persons are
likely to join us. All the four are good men.
Leaving on the 7th, I will go directly to Bombay and thereafter

347. INTERVIEW TO “THE MADRAS MAIL”2
April 22, 1915
Yesterday, a representative of this journal had a long and interesting talk with
Mr. M. K. Gandhi, about various topics of current interest, of which the following is
a summary:
Will you kindly tell me, Mr. Gandhi, what is to be your programme of work,
now that your labours in South Africa have ended in a satisfactory solution of the
Indian situation in that country?

For this year, of which three months have already gone, I am
under instructions from Mr. Gokhale to tour round the country, study
the people and institutions, and form my own conclusions before I
commence any active work. And during this period of probation, I am
also to refrain from speaking on controversial topics on public
platforms. At the end of the year, I shall know definitely what the
questions are to which I shall be able to devote my attention. There is
one thing, however, which it was agreed upon between Mr. Gokhale

Mahatma Munshiram, an Arya Samaj leader who afterwards embraced
sannyasa and adopted the name ‘Shraddhanand’

This appeared under the caption, “Mr. M. K. Gandhi—His Future Work in
India”.
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

411

and myself that I should continue to do, and that was the conduct of
what he called the Phoenix institution. It was so called by Mr. Gokhale
because he saw the experiment I am about to explain to you in
working order partly on the Tolstoy Farm, belonging to Mr.
Kallenbach, and partly at Phoenix, a wayside station on the north coast
of Natal. The experiment consists in training young men, and also
women and children, for long service to the Motherland. It is a feature
of the institution that everyone should perform some form of manual
labour, and as agricultural labour is the best form of manual labour,
everyone is expected to work for a certain period of the day on the
soil. It is proposed also to introduce hand weaving. All who are in the
institution will also study the chief vernaculars of the country, in order
that they may be able to come into contact with the masses in different
parts of India without any difficulty. For mutual intercourse,
vernaculars alone will be used, the use of English being confined as
far as possible to communications with British people, or those who
may not understand any of the chief Indian languages. The vow of
brahmacharya and poverty will be strictly observed at the institution. I
feel that if the experiment proves a success, and there is a large
response from young men, it will automatically solve many of the
important problems that now puzzle or worry us.
Can you tell me something of the proposed methods of work of the institution
and the nature of the service to India?

It is not possible for me to say what form the service will take. It
will largely depend upon the results of my observations during the
period of probation. At the same time, it is easy to see that an
important part of the service is really included in the training itself
that I have mapped out. It ought to be easy for anyone to realize the
various directions in which work may be done in this respect; but I do
not propose to discuss with the public what branches of public activity
are going to occupy my attention and that of my co-workers, if only
because of my promise to Mr. Gokhale that I would refrain from
committing myself to any definite programme until I had previously
studied problems in the manner mentioned. The obligation not to
dothis rests all the more heavily on me in that, I have lost my
helmsman, and I am thrown entirely upon my own resources. I,
therefore, want to act with the greatest caution, and, as far as is
humanly possible, to keep an open mind upon all the burning
questions of the day.
412

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

Was this period of probation imposed on you by Mr. Gokhale because you had
been away from India for so very many years?

Yes, that was his great argument, because I was away from India
for nearly 28 years and all my ideas were formed outside India, and,
therefore, a corrective in the shape of personal contact with
present-day conditions was, in his opinion, absolutely necessary.
Have you noticed any perceptible change in the condition of affairs in India
since you last visited this country?

So far as I have been able to observe and so far as I am
competent to compare things to-day with things as I observed them in
1902, during my brief visit to India, I notice that there is greater
eagerness amongst the younger generation to be of service to the
Motherland, and that there is also great willingness to undertake work
which may require a measure of self-sacrifice.
Our representative then referred to the Indian question in South Africa,
political agitation in India and various other topics, and gathered that Mr. Gandhi
does not lay so much store by agitation for obtaining concessions from the
Government as by working for the moral, material and economic regeneration of
his countrymen, for he is of the opinion that once people make themselves fit by
their character and capacity, the grant of privileges will follow as a matter
of course—in fact, there will be no need for people to ask for concessions, and whatis
granted will be no concessions, for people will have grown into them. Mr. Gandhi
implicitly believes that no agitation for political concessions will do any service to
the country without reform coming from within, at the same time. Mr. Gandhi prefers
to be judged by his conduct rather than by the words he utters, words spoken under the
limitations of an interview not being, in his opinion, capable of expressing all that
the person interviewed might like to say on the subjects discussed.

former Association.
NAWAB SAHEB AND FRIENDS,

On behalf of my wife and myself, I thank both these venerable
associations most sincerely for having organized this function, and the
address1 couched in such beautiful language. I do not think that you
expect any speech from me. I feel that one thing is true about us that
distance lends enchantment to the view. We have now come to work
before the public gaze. I have now to trade with whatever capital I
have brought from South Africa. I am already exhausting that capital.
When we have begun to work before you, you will see us in our
nakedness; and I request you to exercise then that generous spirit for
which our great Motherland is famed. I expect you to excuse any
faults in us, and to take what we give in the best spirit in which we
offer it. (Applause.)

350. INTERVIEW TO ASSOCIATED PRESS, MADRAS
April 23, 1915
A representative of the Associated Press interviewed Mr. Gandhi in course of
which the latter referred to the splendid loyalty of British Indians in South Africa who
stood on the outbreak of war by the Union Government as representing the Imperial
Government. General Botha in an appreciative letter promised to make use of their
services, should the occasion arise.
Asked if any further improvement in the status of Indians was probable after
the war, he said that it largely depended upon the attitude of the Imperial Government
and many other considerations.
Referring to the continuation of his work in South Africa, he said that so far as
legal assistance was concerned, Mr. Polak himself was practising as an attorney and
was eminently fit to advise. There were many able Indian passive resisters, he
continued, who were looking after the situation, so that the problems as they rose
would be fully looked after by local friends of India assisted by Mr. Polak. The Indian
Opinion voicing the passive resisters’ views was managed and controlled by Mr.
West 1 and Mr. C. Gandhi2 .
Questioned as to his future work in India, he said he was touring round the
country as was advised by Mr. Gokhale for study, preliminary to forming a definite
plan of work in the service of the country. He said:

Meanwhile I shall also be continuing the institution which was
being conducted in South Africa and which has for its object the
training of young men for life-long national service. As is well known,
I have already charge of several young men and boys who have
followed me from South Africa and have been either passive resisters
or are sons of passive resisters.

April 24, 1915
On Saturday evening, the Muslim League was At Home to Mr. and Mrs. Gandhi
at Lawley Hall, Mount Road. . . . The refreshments being over, Mr. Yakub Hasan 1
made a short speech . . . . He promised on behalf of the Mussalman community
co-operation in any work he might undertake for the benefit of India.
Mr. Gandhi made a short reply in which he thanked them on behalf of his wife
and himself for their kindness to them. A promise had been made to him and it was an
unconditional promise to co-operate with him in anything he might undertake on
behalf of this country. It was one thing to promise and another thing to fulfil. He
gave them fair warning that he was most exacting to demand the discharge of
obligations, especially when so voluntarily given and it might give them an
uncomfortable hour when he called upon them to discharge their obligations. In this
connection, he remembered two instances of the valuable services rendered by the
Mussalmans in South Africa. One was that of Ahmed Mohamed Kachadia2 who was a
merchant. He had not known a more stubborn man than Kachadia. He went to jail
several times for the sake of the country and his European creditors forced insolvency
upon him for political reasons, but he was able to pay them 20s. in the £. The other
instance that of Abdul Sahiba Muezzin. His services were as valuable as any rendered
by anybody else and he also forsook everything and was reduced to poverty on behalf
of the mother-country. He and his family were now in the Phoenix settlement in
Natal. He again reminded them of the promise they made.
On Sunday afternoon at 2.30 p.m., the ladies of the Abeda Aikya Ananda
Samajum gave an At Home at their premises in Ramaswamy Street, Manady, where an
address was also presented.

352. SPEECH AT MADRAS LAW DINNER
April 24, 1915
Under the auspices of the Madras Bar Association, the Annual Madras Law
Dinner, the third of its kind, came off on Saturday evening last in the open air under
bright moonlight on the extensive grounds adjoining the Moore Pavilion, People’s
Park, Madras. The Hon’ble Mr. F. H. M. Corbet, Advocate-General, was in the
chair.... Mr. Gandhi, who is now in Madras, and who, as a Barrister, had been invited
to the Dinner, was honoured with a seat on the left of the Hon’ble the
Advocate-General. . . . The Chairman asked Mr. Gandhi to propose the toast of “The
British Empire”. . . .In proposing the toast of “The British Empire”, Mr. Gandhi said:
MR. CHAIRMAN, MR. LORD CHIEF JUSTICE, MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN,

When the learned Advocate-General came to me and asked me
to propose this toast, I must confess that I was taken aback a little. I
don’t think he noticed it himself, but I make that confession to you. I
felt that I was invited to be present here as at one time I belonged to
the profession to which you or most of you belong and as I happen to
be in Madras, but that I would be allowed to remain a silent spectator
of what was going on here. But when he mentioned the thing I did not
hesitate to say, “Yes, I shall be pleased to speak to this toast.” During
my three months’ touring in India as also in South Africa, I have been
often questioned how I, a determined opponent of modern civilization
and an avowed patriot, could reconcile myself to loyalty to the British
Empire of which India was such a large part, how it was possible for
me to find it consistent that India and England could work together
for mutual benefit. It gives me the greatest pleasure this evening at this
very great and important gathering to re-declare my loyalty to this
British Empire and my loyalty is based upon very selfish grounds. As
a passive resister I discovered that I could not have that free scope
which I had under the British Empire. I know that a passive resister
has to make good his claim to passive resistance, no matter under what
circumstances he finds himself, and I discovered that the British
Empire had certain ideals with which I have fallen in love, (“Hear,
hear.”) and one of those ideals is that every subject of the British
Empire has the freest scope possible for his energies and efforts and
whatever he thinks is due to his conscience. I think that this is true of
the British Empire as it is not true of any other Governments that we

see. (“Hear, hear.”) I feel as you have perhaps known that I am no
lover of any Governmentand I have more than once said that
Government is best which governs least, and I have found that it is
possible for me to be governed least under the British Empire. Hence
my loyalty to the British Empire. (Loud applause.) And may I before
I sit down and ask you to drink to the prosperity of the British Empire
remind you of one singular incident that happened during this
campaign in far-off South Africa. General Beyers, the trusted
Commander of one of the Forces of the British Empire, rose against
that Empire in open rebellion. It was only possible for him under that
Empire and that Empire alone not to have himself shot on sight.
General Smuts wrote to him in a memorable letter that he himself was
at one time a rebel. He wrote to General Beyers that it was only under
the British Empire that it was possible for him to save his life. Hence
my loyalty to the British Empire. (Loud applause.)
The toast was very enthusiastically honoured.

353. SPEECH AT SOCIAL SERVICE LEAGUE, MADRAS
April 25, 1915
The members of the Social Service League met Mr. Gandhi in the Ranade Hall,
on Sunday (25-4-1915) last at 3.30 p.m. Among those present were Mr. S. Sreenivasa
Aiyangar, Rao Bahadur T. Vijayaraghavachariar, the Hon’ble Mr. V. S. Srinivasa
Sastri, Mr. V. T. Krishnamachariar, Mr. G. A. Natesan and others.
Mr. Gandhi, who was introduced to the meeting by Mr. T. Vijayaraghavachariar, said that he had already heard something of the work which the League
had been doing. He began by saying that all social work must be undertaken in a
spirit of utter humility and self-sacrifice and instanced Mr. Gokhale who had said that
to all true pubic workers, work was its own reward. Absence of recognition or
appreciation should not in the least deter a social worker from carrying on his work
strenuously and with whole-hearted attention. Whatsoever a social worker attempted
to do, he must not cease his labours till he had carried it out to a successful
conclusion. He was against half-hearted social service and said that such work had
better not be done at all. Asked what he would advise the members of the League to do
who were only able to devote a limited time each week, Mr. Gandhi said that they
should devote at least the few hours they could spare with concentrated attention. He
said that if they had the right sort of men undertaking social work, success could

418

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

certainly be hoped for.
He was unable within the time at his disposal to enter into the question of
moral and religious instruction for the depressed classes, while he fully believed that
it was a most important point, a true understanding of which would enable them to get
to the heart of the people among whom they worked.
Asked about the policy of mingling Panchama boys with caste boys in night
schools, he said that there was nothing bad in it at least in the night schools, where
the time of teaching was so short, and that neither the Panchama boys nor the caste
boys would be prejudicially affected in any way. As to elementary education generally
and the policy of extending that education indefinitely, he said that there was no
doubt that it did a great deal of good and was an eminently desirable thing, though it
was not indispensable for the sanitary betterment of the masses. Even people without
a knowledge of the 3 R’s were capable of understanding hygienic principles and
capable of co-operating in any proper scheme of improvement that might be devised
for them. He said that there was a great and crying need for active work in that
direction.... 1 work or put into their head the notion that manual labour was degrading
and said that he saw nothing wrong in a cobbler who had taken the M.A degree
following that profession throughout his life. Regarding intemperance, Mr. Gandhi
said that it was an evil which it was extremely difficult to remedy and that it could be
successfully overcome only by a great religious worker. He gave a practical instance
of this from the experience of a social worker in Poona.
Mr. Gandhi in closing the conversation said that for social service what was
required was not money but men, men of the right sort with right sentiments, with an
abiding love and charity and full of faith in their work. If they did have such men,
money would come, even unasked. Much social work could be done without any
money. It was very difficult for an educated man to understand and appreciate exactly
the feelings that prompted the masses unless he retraced his steps; and it was
impossible for any man however wealthy to do any social work if he was inspired
thereto not by the work itself, but by any feeling of personal ambition. It was easier
for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for such a man to do any effective
social service.
With a vote of thanks to Mr. Gandhi, the meeting terminated at 4 30 p.m.

Mr. Gandhi in his reply thanked them for the honour shown to his wife and
himself and said that the credit for their success in South Africa should be given to
other people who have settled in South Africa. He said it was not the time for him to
detail all they were doing in South Africa The Indians in South Africa were petty
agriculturists, hawkers and petty traders. The cause of the trouble was the stubborn
competition which our people offered to the Europeans domiciled in South Africa.
There were many other things also which accounted for the struggle but the chief
reason was the competition. Although a settlement had been arrived at for the time
being, he said, they might assume that some kind of irritation remained and would
remain so long as that competition remained. He said our people there were not men
with scholarship or university men, but he told them that they were men that would
enable India to be raised in the scale of nations.

and I know that, with experience, he will understand things better.
The Bolpur weather itself is very hot in summer and Ramdas got

people here keep saying harsh things nowadays about the heat.
Speaking for myself, I don’t feel it at all.
I have not told you about the two vows I have taken, 1 never to
eat after sunset in this country and not to have more than five articles
of food on any day. The second vow is rather stiff and may
sometimes cause difficulty. It was worth taking, though and the mind
feels freer as a result of it. We both keep good health.
Revashankerbhai’s elder brother, who has joined me so that he might
overcome his anger, also lives on fruit. There is no one with me from
among our company. I shall spend about four days in Bombay and
then leave for Ahmedabad.

358. SPEECH AT Y. M. C. A., MADRAS3
April 27, 1915
MR. CHAIRMAN AND DEAR FRIENDS,

Madras has wellnigh exhausted the English vocabulary in using
adjectives of virtue with reference to my wife and myself and, if I may
be called upon to give an opinion as to where I have been smothered
with kindness, love and attention, I would have to say: it is Madras.
(Applause.) But, as I have said so often, I believe it of Madras. So it is
no wonder to me that you are lavishing all these kindnesses with
unparalleled generosity, and now the worthy President of the Servants
of India Society—under which Society I am going through a period
of probation—has, if I may say so, capped it all. Am I worthy of these
things? My answer from the innermost recesses of my heart is an
emphatic “No”. But I have come to India to become worthy of every
adjective that you may use, and all my life will certainly be dedicated
to prove worthy of them, if I am to be a worthy servant.

In reply to the Madras students’ address, V. S. Srinivasa Sastri presiding
THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

And so it is that you have sung that beautiful national song1 , on
hearing which all of us sprang to our feet. The poet 2 has lavished all
the adjectives that he possibly could to describe Mother India. He
describes Mother India as sweet-smelling, sweet-speaking, fragrant,
all-powerful, all-good, truthful, a land flowing with milk and honey,
and having ripe fields, fruits and grains, and inhabited by a race of
men of whom we have only a picture in the great Golden Age. He
pictures to us a land which shall embrace in its possession the whole of
the world, the whole of humanity by the might or right not of physical
power but of soul-power. Can we sing that hymn? I ask myself, “Can
I, by any right, spring to my feet when I listen to that song?” The
poet no doubt gave us a picture for our realisation the words of which
simply remain prophetic, and it is for you, the hope of India, to realise
every word that the poet has said in describing this Motherland of
ours. To-day I feel that these adjectives are very largely misplaced in
his description of the Motherland, and it is for you and for me to
make good the claim that the poet has advanced on behalf of his
Motherland.
THE R EAL EDUCATION

You—the students of Madras as well as students all over India—
are you receiving an education which will make you worthy to realise
that ideal and which will draw the best out of you, or is it an education
which has become a factory for making Government employees or
clerks in commercial offices? Is the goal of the education that you are
receiving that of mere employment whether in the Government
departments or other departments? If that be the goal of your
education, if that is the goal that you have set before yourselves, I feel
and I fear that the vision which the poet pictured for himself is far
from being realised. As you have heard me say perhaps, or as you
have read, I am and I have been a determined opponent of modern
civilization. I want you to turn your eyes today upon what is going on
in Europe and if you have come to the conclusion that Europe is
today groaning under the heels of the modern civilization, then you
and your elders will have to think twice before you can emulate that
civilization in our Motherland. But I have been told: “How can we
help it, seeing that our rulers bring that culture to our Motherland?”

VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

Do not make any mistake about it at all. I do not for one moment
believe that it is for any rulers to bring that culture to you unless you
are prepared to accept it, and if it be that the rulers bring that culture
before us, I think that we have forces within ourselves to enable us to
reject . that culture without having to reject the rulers themselves.
(Applause.) I have said on many a platform that the British race is
with us. I decline to go into the reasons why that race is with us, but I
do believe that it is possible for India if she would but live up to the
tradition of the sages of whom you have heard from our worthy
President, to transmit a message through this great race, a message not
of physical might, but a message of love. And then, it will be your
privilege to conquer the conquerors not by shedding blood but by
sheer force of spiritual predominance. When I consider what is going
on today in India, I think it is necessary for us to say what our opinion
is in connection with the political assassinations and political dacoities.
I feel that these are purely a foreign importation which cannot take
root in this land. But you the student world have to beware, lest
mentally or morally you give one thought of approval to this kind of
terrorism. I, as a passive resister, will give you another thing very
substantial for it. Terrorise yourself; search within; by all means resist
tyranny wherever you find it; by all means resist encroachment upon
your liberty, but not by shedding the blood of the tyrant. That is not
what is taught by our religion. Our religion is based upon ahimsa,
which in its active form is nothing but love, love not only to your
neighbours, not only to your friends but love even to those who may
be your enemies.
One word more in connection with the same thing. I think that if
we were to practise truth, to practise ahimsa, we must immediately see
that we also practise fearlessness. If our rulers are doing what in our
opinion is wrong, and if we feel it our duty to let them hear our advice
even though it may be considered sedition, I urge you to speak
sedition but at your peril. You must be prepared to suffer the
consequences. And when you are ready to suffer the consequences
and not hit below the belt, then I think you will have made good your
right to have your advice heard even by the Government.
R IGHTS AND DUTIES

I ally myself with the British Government, because I believe that
it is possible for me to claim equal partnership with every subject of
the British Empire. I today claim that equal partnership. I do not
424

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

belong to a subject rate. I do not call myself a member of a subject
race. But there is this thing: it is not for the British governors to give
you; it is for you to take the thing. I want and I can take the thing.
That I want only by discharging my obligations, Max Muller1 has told
us—we need not go to Max Muller to interpret our own religion but
he says, our religion consists of the four letters “D-u-t-y” and not the
five-letters “R-i-g-h-t”. And if you believe that all that we want can
grow from better discharge of our duty, then think always of your
duty and fighting along those lines, you will have no fear of any man,
you will fear only God. That is the message that my master—if I may
say so, your master, too—Mr. Gokhale has given to us. What is that
message then? It is in the constitution of the Servants of India Society
and that is the message by which I wish to be guided in my life. The
message is to spiritualize the political life and the political institutions
of the country. We must immediately set about realising its practice.
The students cannot be away from politics. Politics is as essential to
them as religion. Politics cannot be divorced from religion. Politics
divorced from religion becomes debasing. Modern culture and
modern civilization are such politics.2 My views may not be acceptable
to you, I know. All the same I can only give you what is stirring me to
my very depths. On the authority of my experiences in South Africa, I
claim that your countrymen who had notthat modern culture but who
had that strength of the Rishis3 of old, who have inherited the
tapascharya4 performed by the Rishis, without having known a single
word of English literature and without knowing anything whatsoever
of the present modern culture, they are able to rise to their full height.
And what has been possible for the uneducated and illiterate
countrymen of ours in South Africa is ten times possible for you and
for me today in this sacred land of ours. May that be your privilege
and may that be my privilege! (Applause.)

364. SPEECH AT RECEPTION AT MAYAVARAM1
May 1, 1915
MR. CHAIRMAN AND FRIENDS,

I am exceedingly thankful to the people of Mayavaram for
presenting this beautiful address to me on the occasion of our simply
passing through your town or village whatever it may be called, on
our way to places where I had hoped to see two widows of men who
were shot during the struggle that went on for eight years in South
Africa. I was able to see only one and I was not able to see the other
whom I hope to see before I leave this great Presidency. It is therefore
a matter of greater pleasure to me that you would not allow us to pass
unnoticed even though it were simply a passing tour through
Mayavaram. But if we have appreciated or if we have received this
great and warm welcome from you, may I, for the first time after my
return to the sacred land, commence to make a return for the great
love that has been shown to us and with your permission I shall try to
do so this evening.
It was quite by accident that I had the great pleasure of receiving
an address from my Panchama brethren, and there they said that they
were without convenience for drinking water, they were without
convenience for living supplies and they could not buy or hold land.

428

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

It was difficult for them even to approach courts. Probably, the last is
due to their fear, but a fear certainly not due to themselves and who is
then responsible for this state of things? Do we propose to perpetuate
this state of things? Is it a part of Hinduism? I do not know; I have
now to learn what Hinduism really is. In so far as I have been able to
study Hinduism outside India, I have felt that it is no part of real
Hinduism to have in its hold a mass of people whom I would call
“untouchables”. If it was proved to me that this is an essential part of
Hinduism, I for one would declare myself an open rebel against
Hinduism itself. (“Hear, hear.”) But I am still not convinced and I
hope that up to the end of my life, I shall remain unconvinced that it
is an essential part of Hinduism. But who is responsible for this class
of untouchables? I have been told that wherever there are Brahmins, it
is they who are enjoying supremacy as a matter of right, but today are
they enjoying that supremacy? If they are, then the sin will fall upon
their shoulders and that is the return I am here to declare and that is
the return I shall have to make for the kindness you are showing to
me; often my love to my friends, relations and even to my dear wife
takes devious ways. So my return here for your kindness is to suggest
a few words which you were probably not prepared to listen to and it
does seem to me that it is high time for Brahmins to regain their
natural prerogative. I recall to my mind the beautiful verse in the
Bhagavad Gita1 . I shall not excite the audience by reciting the verse,
but give you simply a paraphrase. “The true Brahmin is he who is
equi-minded towards a Pundit and a Pariah.”
Are the Brahmins in Mayavaram equi-minded towards the
Pariah and will they tell me if they are so equi-minded and, if so, will
they tell me if others will not follow? Even if they say that they are
prepared to do so but others will not follow, I shall have to disbelieve
them until I have revised my notions of Hinduism. If the Brahmins
themselves consider they are holding a high position by penance and
austerity, then they have themselves much to learn, then they will be
the people who have cursed and ruined the land.
My friend the Chairman has asked me the question whether it
is true that I am at war with my leaders. I say that I am not at war with
my leaders. I seemed to be at war with my leaders because many
things I have heard seem to be inconsistent with my notions of
self-respect and with self-respect to my motherland. I feel that they
1

Ch. V, v . 18

VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

429

are probably not discharging the sacred trust they have taken upon
their shoulders; but I am not sure I am studying or endeavouring to
take wisdom from them, but I failed to take that wisdom. It may be
that I am incompetent and unfit to follow them. So, I shall revise my
ideas. Still I am in a position to say that I seem to be at war with my
leaders. Whatever they do or whatever they say does not somehow or
other appeal to me. The major part of what they say does not seem to
be appealing to me. I find here words of welcome in the English
language. I find in the Congress programme a Resolution on
Swadeshi. If you hold that you are Swadeshi and yet print these in
English, then I am not Swadeshi. To me it seems that it is inconsistent.
I have nothing to say against the English language. But I do say that,
if you kill the vernaculars and raise the English language on the tomb
of the vernaculars (“Hear, hear.”), then you are not favouring
Swadeshi in the right sense of the term. If you feel that I do not
knowTamil, you should pardon me, you should excuse me and teach
me and ask me to learn Tamil and by having your welcome in that
beautiful language, if you translate it to me, then I should think you
are performing some part of the programme. Then only I should
think I am being taught Swadeshi. I asked when we were passing
through Mayavaram whether there had been any handlooms here and
whether there were handloom weavers here. I was told that there were
50 handlooms in Mayavaram. What were they engaged in? They were
simply engaged chiefly in preparing sarees for our women. Then, is
Swadeshi to be confined only to the women? Is it to be only in their
keeping? I do not find that our friends, the male population, also have
their stuff prepared for them in these by these weavers and through
their handlooms. (A voice: There are a thousand handlooms here.)
There are, I understand, one thousand handlooms; so much the worse
for the leaders! (Loud applause.) If these one thousand handlooms are
kept chiefly in attending to the wants of our women, double this
supply of our handlooms and you will have all your wants supplied
by your own weavers and there will be no poverty in the land. I ask
you and ask our friend the President how far he is indebted to foreign
goods for his outfit and if he can tell me that he has tried his utmost
and still has failed to outfit himself, or rather to fit himself out with
Swadeshi clothing and therefore he has got this stuff, I shall sit at his
feet and learn a lesson. What I have been able to learn today is that it
is entirely possible for me, not with any extra cost to fit myself with
Swadeshi clothing. How am I to learn, through those who move or
430

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

who are supposed to be movers in the Congress, the secret of the
Resolution? I sit at the feet of my leaders, I sit-at the feet of
Mayavaram people and let them reveal the mystery, give me the secret
of the meaning, teach me how I should behave myself and tell me
whether it is a part of Swadeshi, whether it is a part of the national
movement that I should drive off those who are without dwellings,
who cry for water and that I should reject the advances of those who
cry for food. These are the questions which I ask my friends here.
Since I am saying something against you, I doubt whether I shall still
enjoy or retain the affection of the student population and whether I
shall still retain the blessings of my leaders. I ask you to have a large
heart and give me a little corner in it. I shall try to steal into that
corner. If you would be kind enough to teach me the wisdom, I shall
learn the wisdom in all humility and in all earnestness. I am praying
for it and I am asking for it. If you cannot teach me, I again declare
myself at war with my leaders. (Loud cheers.)

365. LETTER TO A. H. WEST
May 4, 1915
MY DEAR WEST,

I will take your letter as it comes. It is no use your qualifying as
a lawyer. It is possible you may get some guilty ones discharged on
technicalities and you may get the innocent also saved from
imprisonment. But when you consider what a small percentage of the
population passes through the courts, you at once see that it is no part
of humanitarian work to take up law. All that you can do, without
getting the title of a lawyer you are doing. More you do not need. If
you have leisure, read up your laws by all means as Mr. Gokhale did,
though he never was a lawyer.
I am nearing the end of my first tour. I hope then to write more
regularly and to write for Indian Opinion also. I am going through
very varied experiences. India continues to satisfy my aspirations. I
see much to dishearten me and I see much to encourage me.
We are both keeping fairly good health. If we can settle down
somewhere, we should do better. More than this, I have not the time to
say just now.

MY DEAR SISTER,

I did not reply to your last letter as I had hoped to be able at the
time of replying to tell you when I was likely to visit Hyderabad. But
the receipt of your booklet with the beautiful inscription in it compels
me to write to you now, even though I cannot fix the date of my
coming to Hyderabad.
I thank you for the inscription. Yes, Mr. Gokhale longed to have
you as a full servant of India. Your acknowledgment of discipleship
fills one with new hope. But of this more when we meet. For me the
death of the Master has drawn me closer to him. I see him and
appreciate his worth as I never did before; for the lover, the loved one
never dies.
Are you keeping well in health?
I leave Madras on the 7th instant for Bombay.
My permanent address is Servants of India Society, Poona.
Mrs. Gandhi, who is with me, sends her love to you.
Yours sincerely,

367. LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI
Vaishakh Vad 5 [May 4, 1915] 1
CHI. NARANDAS,

I shall arrive there on the 10th or perhaps the 9th. So far as I
know, Chi. Jamnadas had joined the institution, but there may have
been a misunderstanding on my part. Jamnadas thinks that he had
taken no vow. One who does not take any vow cannot be a member,
though such a one can stay as a student. Even a student must observe
the vows while he lives in the institution. A member must observe
them all his life. Jamnadas wants to remain outside the institution and
observe its rules. It seems Harilal’s letter has had some effect on his
mind. He is hurt by the former’s allegations.
Groundnuts and dates have done most of us no harm. By not
eating more than five articles on any day, we advance in the
observance of the vow of non-violence, as, on that particular day at
least, we spare all vegetable life excepting the articles in question. The
vow concerning [the control of] the palate will also be better observed
because one would not have more than five things to enjoy for their
taste. The vow of non-stealing will be conformed to because, in
drawing nourishment from five articles, one would not be over-eating
and there would be greater economy besides. I shall have to think
much now before eating the groundnut sweet. As it would contain
three articles, I could have only two in addition. Cardamom and
similar things would also count as separate articles. This is a difficult
vow to have taken but I am getting used to it. The mind, the dog that it
still is, runs about like one seeking to extract the utmost relish from
the five articles. More you may ask me when we meet. I shall be in
Bombay for as short a time as possible. The mind has only one
thought, settling the affairs at Ahmedabad.
Inform Madhavji2 about the date of my arrival there.

368. SPEECH AT NELLORE1
May 5, 1915
MR. CHAIRMAN AND FRIENDS,

I do not propose to inflict a speech upon you. I am extremely
zealous of individual liberty about which we heard this morning from
the eloquent lips of Mrs. Besant2 and from Mr. Sastriar, with his
matchless, merciless, severe and cold logic. I was so zealous of your
liberty that I had concocted a plot, but, unfortunately it failed. I was
not able to draw in our worthy Chairman of the Reception Committee
and the present president of this Conference. I wanted to suggest to
them that for the Congresses and for the future Conferences, they
might lead the way by not reading their addresses but by simply
distributing their addresses for us to read.
It is an accident that this resolution3 follows on two resolutions
one with reference to my noble master Mr. Gokhale, and the other to
the noble Viceroy to whom fitting tribute has been made, and I
amhere to acknowledge the indebtedness that your countrymen in
South Africa owe to the Viceroy.
Sir, if my wife and I are worthy of anything that has been
said on this platform and on many a platform, I have repeated, and I
am here to repeat, that the inspiration that we derived was from an
Indian source and that was from the late Mr.Gokhale. His life, his message, his words, his methods, have been to me a guiding star, and they
will still remain an important guide; and we can best revere
hismemory by translating some part of his life into our own. My life
is dedicated to that, and I appeal to you, my countrymen, not to spoil

Annie Besant (1847-1933), President of the Theosophical Society in 1907;
also founder of Central Hindu College at Benares; President, Indian National
Congress, 1917. She had said: “In the successful issue of the struggle in South Africa
is a presage of the successful termination of the struggle for liberty on the Indian
soil. We thank him not only for what he did, but also in that what he did will
strengthen the Indian nation in the future. Mr. Gandhi’s great help to us is that of
inspiration—an inspiration to self-sacrifice, an inspiration to following of a great
ideal, the recognition of the fact that there is no dishonour in anything that is endured
for the sake of right and justice, and that a prison is no dishonour when the soul
within it is free, and when prison is accepted as the price of that liberty.”

appreciation of the enormous sacrifices....” of Gandhiji and Kasturba

us, not to isolate us in the service, not to overrate what we have done in
South Africa. Let me make this humble appeal. Let what is done in
South Africa be buried there. Our countrymen in South Africa know
well of what has been done there. It is impossible to stand here upon
any reputation we may have built in South Africa. You will spoil us
for two reasons. We may lose our heads and so be lost to the country.
The other is that you may raise enormous expectations about us and
disappointment may at last be the result.

369. SPEECH AT STUDENTS’ MEETING, NELLORE
May 6, 1915
The address having been read and presented to Mr. Gandhi, he then thanked the
students for taking such a lively part in the Conference 1 and serving as volunteers.’
He said that unless what had been said on the platform was translated into action and
interest kept up, these Conferences were of no use. A great deal was said about the
encouragement of industries on the platform, but when he went into that part of the
public hall, where clothes made of fly shuttle weaving and brought from
Narayanavanam, Chittoor District, were exhibited and enquired of the owner how
much worth of clothes he had brought, and how much of it he had sold, he found that
out of Rs. 1,000 worth of clothes, he had sold only Rs. 50 or Rs. 60 worth. The
clothes were good enough, and in spite of it even the educated could not be induced to
put their hands into their pockets and purchase some if only to mark their
appreciation of the Swadeshi enterprise. When such was the state of encouragement
offered to local indigenous industries, there was no hope of advancement. He exhorted
the students to set a practical example, and not rest contented with merely making
speeches.

[NELLORE ,

May 6, 1915]
I think it is all to one’s good to observe these vows. I believe in
making a supreme effort for rising above this earthly existence. It
seems to me that service of the nation will include such an effort. Our
aims are right. I think our faith in them is unshakable. It becomes
stronger through experience. I should like you to follow the same
reasoning. I don’t want any of you to submit to my wishes and take
things on trust. Nor will I force my views [on you]. You may all take
the vows when they appeal to you.
There will be some gentlemen from Madras with me. I see that
the number will go up. I am bringing along Selvan’s son.2 You know
him. He is the little one who used to be naughty in Phoenix.
I am writing this from Nellore. I am attending a conference3
here. I shall leave tomorrow morning.

expanded and embraced the following further points, viz., (1) the removal of racial
disability in the immigration legislation of the Union of South Africa; (2) the
restoration of the status of Indian wives whether married in accordance with Hindu or
Mahomedan religious rites as it originally existed before what was known in South
by every ex-indentured Indian, his wife and his children—male and female—males
after reaching 16 years, females after reaching 12 if they decided to settle
in the province of Natal as free men; (4) just administration of existing laws
specially affecting British Indians with regard to vested rights. All these points were
completely gained under the settlement of last year, and they have been embodied
so far as legislation was necessary in what was known as the Indians’ Relief Act 1
and otherwise in the correspondence that took place between General Smuts and
himself immediately after the passing of the Act referred to. Such being the case and
as the Indian South African League was formed solely for the purpose of assisting
the struggle, it could well dissolve itself. Mr. Gandhi referred also to the
administration of the funds that were sent to him from India and other parts of the
Empire. He said that at every stage of the struggle a complete statement of income and
expenditure was published. The first was sent to Mr. Gokhale accompanied with a
public letter2 . The second statement was rendered to Mr. Ratan Tata3 also accompanied
with a public letter. The third was ready and was to have been published after
consultation with Mr. Gokhale and the general committee at Bombay. Such was Mr.
Gokhale’s desire. He (the speaker) was now waiting to see Mr. Nut, Mr. Petit, the
secretary of the committee, and then publish the statement. 4 Mr. Gandhi added there
were nearly 30 passive resisters including their families in India who were to be
supported. These included the widows and children of two men who were
shot in the course of the struggle. He therefore suggested that the small balance
which was still with the Indian South African League might well be devoted to their
assistance. 5 Mr. Gandhi desired to take the opportunity to express the thanks of the
South African Indians for the great and valuable assistance it had rendered
to them during the most critical times of the struggle. He was not going to mention
any names but he felt it his duty to convey in person, as the interpreter of the wishes
of many Transvaal deportees who were in Madras in 1909, their heartfelt thanks
to Mr. Natesan for the devotion which he displayed in looking after their interest

372. SPEECH AT BANGALORE1
May 8, 1915
MY DEAR COUNTRYMEN,

Before I perform this ceremony to which you have called me, I
wish to say this to you that you have given me a great opportunity or
rather a privilege on this great occasion. I saw in the recitation2 , the
beautiful recitation that was given to me, that God is with them whose
garment was dusty and tattered. My thoughts immediately went to the
end of my garment; I examined and found that it is not dusty and it is
not tattered; it is fairly spotless and clean. God is not in me. There are
other conditions attached; but in these conditions too I may fail; and
you, my dear countrymen, may also fail; and if we do tend this well,
we should not dishonour the memory of one whose portrait you have
asked me to unveil this morning. I have declared myself his disciple in
the political field and I have3 him as my Rajya Guru; and this I claim
on behalf of the Indian people. It was in 1896 that I made this
declaration, and I do not regret having made the choice.
Mr. Gokhale taught me that the dream of every Indian, who
claims to love his country, should be to act in the political field,
should be not to glorify in language, but to spiritualise the political
life of the country, and the political institutions of the country. He
inspired my life and is still inspiring [it]; and in that I wish to purify
myself and spiritualise myself. I have dedicated myself to that ideal. I
may fail, and to what extent I may fail, I call myself to that extent an
unworthy disciple of my master.
What is the meaning of spiritualising the political life of

the country? What is the meaning of spiritualising myself? That
question has come before me often and often and to you it may seem
one thing, to me it may seem another thing; it may mean
differentthings to the different members of the Servants of India
Society itself. It shows much difficulty and it shows the difficulties of
all those who want to love their country, who want to serve their
country and who want to honour their country. I think political life
must be an echo of private life and that there cannot be any divorce
between the two.
I was by the side of that saintly politician to the end of his life
and I found no ego in him. I ask you, members of the Social Service
League, if there is no ego in you. If he wanted to shine, —he wanted
to shine in the political field of his country,—he did so not in order
that he might gain public applause, but in order that his country might
gain. He developed every particular faculty in him, not in order to win
the praise of the world for himself, but in order that his country might
gain. He did not seek public applause, but they [sic] were showered
upon him, they were thrust upon him; he wanted that his country
might gain and that was his great inspiration.
There are many things for which India is blamed, very rightly,
and if you should add one more to our failure, the blame will descend
not only on you but also on me for having participated in today’s
functions. But I have great faith in my countrymen.
You ask me to unveil this portrait today, and I will do so in all
sincerity and sincerity should be the end of your life. (Loud and
continued applause.)

373. TALK WITH BANGALORE CITIZENS
May 8, 1915
Mr. Gandhi was met today at his temporary residence Seshadri Road,
Bangalore, by a few citizens who engaged him in conversation.
Questioned as to India’s poverty, Mr. Gandhi said India was becoming poorer
and poorer, on account of disappearance of the handloom industries owing to violent
competition and export of raw materials.
He said:
We have lost much of our self-respect on account of being too much
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

439

Europeanised. We think and speak in English. Thereby, we impoverish our
vernaculars, and estrange the feelings of the masses. A knowledge of English is not
very essential to the service of our Motherland. Turning to caste, he said:

Caste is the great power and secret of Hinduism.
GANDHI’S HOME
Asked where he would stay, Mr. Gandhi replied:

Great pressure is brought down on me to settle in Bengal; but I
have a great capital in the store of my knowledge in Gujarat and I get
letters from there.
WANTED A LIBRARY

Vernacular literature is important. I want to have a library of all
books. I invite friends for financial aid to form libraries and to locate
them.
MODERN C IVILIZATION A C URSE

Modern civilization is a curse in Europe as also in India. War is
the direct result of modern civilization. Every one of the powers was
making preparations for war.
GREAT MORAL F ORCE

Passive resistance is a great moral force meant for the weak, also
for the strong. Soul-force depends on itself. Ideals must work in
practice, otherwise they are not potential. Modern civilization is brute
force.
It is one thing to know the ideal and another thing to practise it.
That will ensure greater discipline, which means greater service and
greater service means greater gain to Government. Passive resistance is
a high aggressive thing. The attribute of soul is restlessness; there is
room for every phase of thought.
THREE EVILS

Money, land and woman are the sources of evil and evil has to
be counteracted. I need not possess land, nor a woman, nor money, to
satisfy my luxuries. I do not want to be unhinged because others are
unhinged. If ideals are practised, there will be less room for
mischievous activities. Public life has to be moulded.
S ADHUS IN INDIA

Every current has to change its course. There are one and a half
440

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

million sadhus1 and if every sadhu did his duty, India could achieve
much. Jagatguru Sankaracharya does not deserve that appellation
because he has no more force in him.
INDIAN IDEALS

Malicious material activity is no good. It finds out means tomultiply
one’s luxuries. Intense, gross modern activity should not be imposed
in Indian institutions, which. have to be remodelled on ideals taken
from Hinduism. . Virtue as understood in India is not understood in
foreign lands. Dasharatha2 is considered a fool in foreign lands for his
having kept his promise to his wife3 . India says a promise is a promise.
That is a good deal. Material activity is mischievous. Truth shall
conquer in the end.
EMIGRANTS

Emigration does no good to the country from which people
emigrate. Emigrants do not return better moral men. The whole thing
is against Hinduism. Temples do not flourish. There are no
opportunities for ceremonial functions. Priests do not come, and at
times, they are merely men of straw. Immigrants play much mischief
and corrupt society. It is not enterprise. They may earn more money
easily in those parts, which means they do not want to toil and remain
straight in the methods of earning. Immigrants are not happier and
have more material wants.
THEOSOPHICAL S OCIETY
Questioned about the Theosophical Society, Mr. Gandhi said:

There is a good deal of good in the Theosophical Society,
irrespective of individuals. It has stimulated ideals and thought.

374. SPEECH AT CIVIC RECEPTION, BANGALORE1
May 8, 1915
MR. CHAIRMAN AND MY FRIENDS,

I think it is simply impertinent to tell you that I thank you
most sincerely on behalf of my wife and on my own behalf
for the signal honour you have shown me. Words fail me, and
one thought oppresses me all the more. Am I, are we, worthy of the
honour? Are we worthy of the oriental generosity of this love? The
Chairman2 has furnished this ground for the love, and quoted Mr.
Gokhale. Let me not bask in that reputation. See me please in the
nakedness of my working, and in my limitations, you will then know
me. I have to tread on most delicate ground, and my path is destined
to be through jungles and temples. The glamour produced by the
saintly politician has vanished, and let us be judged eye to eye. So
many have assembled here to do honour. This morning 3 , you did
greater honour. Greater honour was shown by the Reception
Committee in arranging for the conversation 4 , in order to open my
heart to you and to understand the innermost thoughts in you by
quiet conversation between my countrymen and myself.5
I did not want to be dragged in the carriage. There is a meaning
in that. Let us not spoil our public men by dragging them. Let them
work silently. We should not encourage the thought that one has to
work because one will be honoured similarly. Let public men feel that
they will be stoned, they will be neglected and let them still love the
country, for service is its own reward. A charge has been brought
against us that we as a nation are too demonstrative and lack
business-like methods. We plead guilty to the charge. Are we to copy
modern activities or are we to copy the ancient civilization which has
survived so many shocks? You and I have to act on the political

conquer the conquerors. The day will dawn then when we can
consider an Englishman as a fellow citizen. (Cheers.) That day will
shortly come; but it may be difficult to conceive when. I have had
signal opportunities of associating myself with Englishmen of
character, devotion, nobility and influence. I can assure you that the
present wave of activity is passing away and a new civilization is
coming shortly which will be a nobler one. India is a great
dependency and Mysore is a great Native State. It must be possible
for you to transmit this message to British governors, and to
British statesmen; the message is: “Establish a Ram Rajya in Mysore
and have as your minister a Vashishta who will command obedience.”

Hence the accommodation to be provided should be such that
those with families can stay separately and the rest together.
Having regard to this, three kitchens and rooms measuring

In addition to this, a room and cupboards for holding a thousand books will also be required.
At least five acres of land will be required for cultivation.

provide this from our produce during the first year. Thus, with an
average of 50 inmates, the annual expenditure will come to Rs. 6,000.
I have understood it to be the desire of the [local] leaders that
we should merely experiment for a year in Ahmedabad. If that is so,
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

445

Ahmedabad should bear the whole of this burden. My demand was
that Ahmedabad should provide me with land and building complete,
while I would obtain the remaining expenses from elsewhere or by
other means. As we have now changed the basis, I think Ahmedabad
should bear the entire burden’ for a year or any shorter period. If
Ahmedabad is not prepared to do this for a year, I am in a position to
provide for ‘the boarding charges.
As I have worked out this estimate in a hurry, it is likely that I
have missed some few items. Moreover, I have no information about
local conditions, except for boarding charges. Hence my estimates
may well be incorrect.
If Ahmedabad bears all the expenses, the figures under the
different heads will be as follows:
Rent—bungalow and farm land
Cost of cupboards for books
Carpenter’s tools
Cobbler’s tools
Kitchen utensils
Bullock-cart or horse-carriage
Boarding charges for one year: 6000
I think we shall need blacksmith’s and mason’s tools and many
others besides. But I have not taken into account these and also
equipment for educational purposes. Five or more indigenous looms
will be the main requirements among the latter, as far as I can see.

377. LETTER TO HERMANN KALLENBACH
AHMEDABAD ,

May 13 [1915]
MY DEAR FRIEND,

Last week no letter went to you. I miscalculated the mail day and
found myself at a place from where I could not send a letter to fit in
with the mail day at Bombay.
So you have changed the restaurant life for the life at Walden. I
do not mind, if it gives you some peace. The chief thing is to occupy
yourself in something useful. It is quite clear you will not study there.
What you will do when you rejoin me remains to be seen. I see no
present chance of my 1 securing permit for you. With the bitterness
between the parties increasing, no permits will be granted. I observe
too that you are no longer meeting the Roberts. I do hope that this
forced separation will nerve you and fit you for the struggle to come.
For whilst the atmosphere here is grand, it requires all the greater
effort for the perception it gives one.
I am now at a place where, for the time being at least, I shall
have fixed up the Phoenix party. We have almost arranged. I am
being given a temporary residential place, tools, etc. The leaders here
will watch me and my work and meanwhile look about for a place
which will be an agricultural site. I shall then have to think out a plan
for buildings, etc. In this you could have advised most efficiently.
However, just now I must simply do the best I can.
My health continues to be good. The pain in the side somehow
or other does not leave me entirely. It is difficult to understand the
thing. The fruit diet continues and the restriction to five articles does
not cause any trouble. The sunset arrangement answers admirably.1
1

The source here has “you”.
The reference apparently is to the vows Gandhiji took on April 9 at Hardwar;
vide “Speech at Reception by Indians Christians, Madras”, 26-4-1915.

[AHMEDABAD ,]

Vaishakh Vad 0)), Thursday [May 13, 1915] 2
CHI. MAGANLAL,

I am writing this letter on Thursday. You will get it on Monday
or Sunday. It has been decided to rent a bungalow 3 here and later
look about for land, etc. The rent for the bungalow and the cost of
tools, etc., are to be borne by Ahmedabad. And of utensils as well.
Boarding charges are to be borne by us. I am leaving for Rajkot
today. I shall return to Ahmedabad at the latest on Tuesday. If you
start from there4 on Monday, you will reach Delhi on Tuesday
morning, and Ahmedabad on Wednesday. Fix the date and let me
know by wire when you will start. Tell me in the telegram when you
will reach here. I enclose [currency] notes for Rs. 200/-. If I am not
mistaken, you will need 16 and a half tickets.
Send away Pandit to Calcutta now, though, of course, if you feel
that he may join you, let him. He should pay the fare himself,
however.
I shall be in Rajkot on the day you get this letter, and in
Ahmedabad when you arrive there.

You will get the most convenient train via Delhi: Laksar,
Saharanpur, Delhi Ajmer, Palanpur and Ahmedabad. If you purchase
at Hardwar a through ticket to Ahmedabad, you will save Rs. 5/-. The
fare is two and a half pies per mile for the first 100 miles and 2 pies
beyond that. The Mail has only Intermediate Class. There is a mixed’
third-class Express from Delhi, reaching Ahmedabad in 27 to 30
hours. It seems you will have to change at least at Laksar, Saharanpur
and Delhi. If a large stock of dates, etc., remains over, it will be better
to buy it. They should not feel at the Gurukul later that we had been a
burden there.
There is nothing more to write.

379. LETTER TO V. S. SRINIVASA SASTRI
AHMEDABAD ,

May 14, 1915
DEAR MR. SHASTRIAR1 ,

I want to have a quiet chat with you regarding your health. I feel
very strongly about it. I am sure that you can by regulating your diet
and taking water treatment completely cure yourself while there is yet
time. You owe it to the Society and the country to get cured when it is
so easily possible to do so. In the treatment I suggest, there need be
not a day’s interruption in your public work.’ The one thing needful
is to follow the cure religiously. Prolonged treatment is not necessary
to notice its results. And here it is:
2 hip baths per day of at least 20 minutes’ duration, the baths to
be taken not before the completion of three hours after a meal. Two
hours’ gentle walk in the open air morning and evening.
Only two meals per day, the last not after sunset.
Every morsel of diet must be chewed with deliberation so that it
goes down the throat not as a solid mass but as a smooth thick liquid.

Whether you have done this or not can always be noticed in your
stools.
The diet to consist of bananas, mangoes, oranges, oats, figs
(fresh or dried), sultanas, grapes, lemons, tamarind, papaw, pineapple,
prunes, cocoanut, groundnuts, almonds, pistachios, walnuts, olive oil, if
necessary.
Only two varieties of nuts may be taken during the day. In
quantity no more than 4 ounces of both during the day. At the
commencement, i.e., for 4 days nuts may be omitted altogether and
then gradually introduced.
Either lemons or tamarind may be taken. Figs, dates and other
dried fruit should be well washed and soaked for six hours before
eating. The water in which they are soaked should be drunk.
If olive oil be taken, no more than an ounce per day may be
taken. Nine, fair-sized bananas should be enough per day along with
the other fruits.
However, quantity may be regulated by each one for himself.
A month’s trial without a break is sure to show you that
complete recovery lies in this direction and no other. Of course, all
drinks—coffee, tea, soda water, etc., and betel leaves, etc., must be
eschewed during the treatment. Later on you will go back to your old
diet with variations that you may have picked up during the treatment.
Do please think of this thing seriously.
Pray remember us both to your mother and Mrs. Shastriar.
Yours sincerely

Vaishakh, Sud 5, Wednesday [May 19, 1915] 1
CHI. NARANDAS,

I have come here for a day, as the Thakore Saheb was keen that
I should. Santok and the girls have also come along. Jamnadas will
stay in Rajkot for the time being.
Send the luggage lying with Revashankerbhai, as also that with
you and Kalyandas2 , to Ahmedabad in a goods train. The beddings, I
think, will have to be covered with hessian and stitched in.
Alternatively, a friend coming this way could bring them along. Boxes
which may have no locks should be packed well. Those containing
glassware should be handled carefully.
There is a telegram from Chi. Maganlal saying that they will all
leave Hardwar on Thursday. So they should be in Ahmedabad on
Saturday or Sunday.
Shamaldas has come with me. Whether he will stay on, or what
he will do, I can’t say.
Respected Khushalbhai and I have had long talks. I feel all the
time that there is something owing from him to me. In the same
degree that he has satisfied me, Nandkorbhabhi, Gangabhabhi and
Gokibehn3 have disappointed me.
More when we meet.

This is only a draft printed for circulation among friends for

SATYAGRAHASHRAM?5

OBJECT

The object of the Ashram is to learn how to serve the
motherland one’s whole life and to serve it.
C LASSES

The Ashram consists of three classes Controllers, Novitiates and
Students.
(1) CONTROLLERS

The Controllers believe that, in order to learn how to serve the
country, the following observances should be enforced in their own
lives and they have been trying to do so for some time.
1. V OW OF TRUTH

It is not enough for a person under this vow that he does not
ordinarily resort to untruth; such a person ought to know that no
deception may be practised even for the good of the country. One
should consider the example of Prahlad in order to understand how
one should behave towards elders such as parents in the interests of
Truth.

This was revised and published as third edition on November 7, 1915.
The Ashram, as stated in the third edition, was established on May 20.

2

VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

453

2. V OW OF NON -VIOLENCE

It is not enough to refrain from taking the life of any living
being. He who has pledged himself to this vow may not kill eventhose
whom he believes to be unjust; he may not be angry with them, he
must love them; thus, he would oppose the tyranny whether of parents,
governments or others, but will never kill or hurt the tyrant. The
follower of truth and non-violence will offer satyagraha against
tyranny and win over the tyrant by love; he will not carry out the
tyrant’s will but he will suffer punishment even unto death for
disobeying his will until the tyrant himself is won over.
3. VOW OF C ELIBACY

It is well-nigh impossible to observe these two vows unless
celibacy too is observed; and for this vow it is not enough that one
does not look upon another woman with a lustful eye, one has so to
control the animal passions that they will not be moved even in
thought; if one is married, one will not have sexual intercourse even
with one’s wife, but, regarding her as a friend, will establish with her a
relationship of perfect purity.
4. C ONTROL OF THE P ALATE

Until one has overcome the palate, it is difficult to observe the
foregoing vows, more especially that of celibacy. Control of the palate
should therefore be treated as a separate observance by one desirous
of serving the country and, believing that eating is only for sustaining
the body, one should regulate and purify one’s diet day by day. Such
a person will immediately, or gradually, as he can, leave off such
articles of food as may tend to stimulate animal passions.
5. V OW OF NON -STEALING

It is not enough not to steal what is commonly considered as
other men’s property. One who has pledged himself to this vow
should realize that Nature provides from day to day just enough and
no more for one’s daily needs by way of food and so hold it theft to
use articles of food, dress, etc., which one does not really need and live
accordingly.
6. V OW OF NON -POSSESSION

It is not enough not to possess and keep much, but it is
454

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

necessary not to keep anything which may not be absolutely
necessary for the nourishment and protection of our body: thus, if
one can do without chairs, one should do so. He who has taken this
vow will always bear this in mind and endeavour to simplify his life
more and more.
S UBSIDIARY OBSERVANCES

Two other vows follow from the foregoing.1
1. V OW OF S WADESHI

The person who has taken the vow of Swadeshi will never use
articles which conceivably involve violation of truth in their
manufacture or on the part of their manufacturers. It follows, for
instance, that a votary of truth will not use articles manufactured in the
mills of Manchester, Germany or India, for he cannot be sure that
they involve no such violation of truth. Moreover, labourers suffer
much in the mills. The generation of tremendous heat causes
enormous destruction of life. Besides, the loss of workers’ lives in the
manufacture of machines and of other creatures through excessive
heat is something impossible to describe. Foreign cloth and cloth
made by means of machinery are, therefore, tabooed to a votary of
non-violence as they involve triple violence. Further reflection will
show that the use of foreign cloth can be held to involve a breach of
the vows of non-stealing and non-possession. We follow custom and,
for better appearance, wear foreign cloth in preference to the cloth
made on our own handlooms with so little effort. Artificial
beautifying of the body is a hindrance to. a brahmachari and so, even
from the point of view of that vow, machine-made cloth is taboo.
Therefore, the vow of Swadeshi requires the use of simple clothing
made on simple handlooms and stitched in simple style, foreign
buttons, cuts, etc., being avoided. The same line of reasoning may be
applied to all other articles.
2. V OW OF F EARLESSNESS

He who is acted upon by fear can hardly observe the vows of
truth, etc. The Controllers will, therefore, constantly endeavour to be
free from the fear of kings or society, one’s caste or family, thieves,
robbers, ferocious animals such as tigers, and even of death. One who
1

Omitted in the third edition

VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

455

observes the vow of fearlessness will defend himself or others by
truth-force or soul-force.
3. V OW AGAINST UNTOUCHABILITY1

According to Hindu religion as traditionally practised,
communities such as Dhed, Bhangi, etc., known by the names of
Antyaj, Pancham, Achhut and so on, are looked upon as untouchable.
Hindus belonging to other communities believe that they will be
defiled it they touch a member of any of the said communities and, if
anyonedoes so accidentally, he thinks that he has committed a sin.
The founders of the Ashram believe that this practice is a blot on
Hindu religion. Themselves staunch Hindus, they believe that the
Hindu race will continue to add to its load of sin so long as it regards
a single community as untouchable. Some of the consequences of this
practice have been terrible. In order to be free from this sin, the
Ashram inmates are under a vow to regard the untouchable
communities as touchable; actually one Dhed family was staying in
the Ashram, and it is still there, when the third edition of these rules
was being drawn up. It lives exactly in the same condition as others in
the Ashram do. This vow does not extend to association for purpose
of eating. All that is desired is the eradication of the evil of
untouchability.
VARNASHRAM2

The Ashram does not follow the varnashram dharma. Where
those in control of the Ashram will take the place of the pupils’
parents and where life-long vows of celibacy, non-hoarding, etc., are
to be observed, varnashram dharma has no scope. The Ashram
inmates will be in the stage of sanyasis 3 and so it is not necessary for
them to follow the rules of this dharma. Apart from this, the Ashram
has a firm belief in the varnashram dharma. The discipline of caste
seems to have done no harm to the country; on the contrary, rather.
There is no reason to believe that eating in company promotes
brotherhood ever so slightly. In order that the varnashram dharma
and caste discipline might in no way be undermined, the Ashram
inmates are under obligation, whenever they stir out, to subsist on

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

fruits if they cannot cook their own food.
MOTHER TONGUE

It is the belief of the Controllers that no nation or any group
thereof can make real progress by abandoning its own language, they
will, therefore, use their own language. As they desire to be on terms
of intimacy with their brethren from all parts of India, they will also
learn the chief Indian languages; as Sanskrit is a key to Indian
languages, they will learn that too.
MANUAL WORK

The Controllers believe that body labour is a duty imposed by
nature upon mankind. Such labour is the only means by which
manmay sustain himself; his mental and spiritual powers should be
used for the common good only. As the vast majority in the world live
on agriculture, the Controllers will always devote some part of their
time to working on the land; when that is not possible, they will
perform some other bodily labour.
WEAVING

The Controllers believe that one of the chief causes of poverty
in the land is the virtual disappearance of spinning-wheels and
handlooms. They will, therefore, make every effort to revive this
industry by themselves weaving cloth on handlooms.
P OLITICS

Politics, economic progress, etc., are not unconnected matters;
knowing that they are all rooted in religion, the Controllers will make
an effort to learn and teach politics, economics, social reform, etc., in a
religious spirit and work in these fields with all the zeal that they can
command.
(2) NOVITIATES

Those who are desirous of following the foregoing programme
but are not able immediately to take the necessary vows may be
admitted as Novitiates. It is obligatory upon them to conform to all
the observances which are followed by Controllers the while that they
are in the Ashram. They will acquire the status of Controllers when
they are able to take the necessary vows for life.
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

457

(3) STUDENTS

1 Any children, whether boys or girls, from four years and upwards
may be admitted with the consent of their parents.1
2 Parents will have to surrender all control over their children.
3 Children will not be permitted to visit their parents for any reason
until the whole course of study is finished.
4 Students will be taught to observe all the vows intended for the
Controllers.
5 They will receive instruction in religion, agriculture, handloomweaving and letters.
6 Instruction in letters will be through the students’ own languages
and will include History, Geography, Arithmetic, Algebra, Geometry,
Economics, etc., the learning of Sanskrit, Hindi and at least one
Dravidian language being obligatory.
7 English will be taught as a second language.
8 Urdu, Bengali Tamil, Telugu, Devnagari and Gujarati scripts will
be taught to all.
9 The Controllers believe that the whole course will be completed in
ten years.2 Upon reaching the age of majority, students will be given
the option of taking the vows or retiring from the Ashram. This will
make it possible for those to whom the programme has not
commended itself to leave the Ashram.
10 They will exercise this option at an age when they will require no
assistance from their parents or guardians.
11 Every endeavour will be made from the very beginning to see that,
when they leave, they will be strong enough to have no fear what they
would do for their maintenance.
12 Grown-up persons also may be admitted as students.
13 As a rule, everyone will wear the simplest and a uniform style of
dress.
14 Food will be simple. Chillies will be excluded altogether and
generally no condiments will be used excepting salt, pepper and
turmeric. Milk, ghee and other milk products being a hindrance to a

of age will not be admitted if their parents do not join at the same time.”

celibate life and milk being often a cause of tuberculosis and having
the same stimulating qualities as meat, they will be most sparingly
used, if at all. Meals will be served thrice a day and will include dried
and fresh fruits in liberal quantities. All inmates of the Ashram will be
taught the general principles of hygiene.
15 No holidays will be observed in this Ashram but, for one and a
half days every week, the ordinary routine will be altered and
everyone will have some time to attend to his private work.
16 During three months in the year, those whose health permits it will
be taken on a tour, on foot for the most part, of India.
17 Nothing will be charged either from Students or Novitiates
towards their monthly expenditure, but parents or the members
themselves will be expected to contribute whatever they can towards
the expenses of the Ashram.
MISCELLANEOUS

Administration of the Ashram will rest with a body of
Controllers. The Chief Controller will have the right to decide whom
to admit and to which category.
The expenses of the Ashram are being met from moneys
already received by the Chief Controller or to be received from
friends who may have some faith in the Ashram.
The Ashram is accommodated in two houses on the banks of the
Sabarmati, Ahmedabad, on the road to Sarakhej across the Ellis
Bridge.
It is expected that in a few months, about 250 acres of land will
be acquired in the vicinity of Ahmedabad and the Ashram located
thereon.
A R EQUEST

Visitors are requested to observe all the Ashram rules during
their stay there. Every endeavour will be made to make them
comfortable; but the management will be thankful to them if they
bring with them their bedding and utensils for meals, as the Ashram
rules permit the stocking of only a minimum of articles.
Those parents who intend sending their children to the Ashram
are advised to pay a visit to the Ashram. No boy or girl will be
admitted before he or she has been duly tested.

DAILY R OUTINE1

(l)
An effort is being made to see that everyone in the
Ashram gets up at 4 o’clock. The first bell rings at 4.
(2) It is obligatory on all, except those who are ill, to get up at

383. LETTER TO V. S. SRINIVASA SASTRI
AHMEDABAD ,

May 20 [1915] 1
DEAR MR. SHASTRIAR,

I have just returned from a brief domestic visit to Rajkot to find
your two letters. If I may suggest, I think that you should respond to
Sir William’s call. Sir Pherozeshaw is likely to take the same view that
Mrs. Besant does. To me it is enough that Sir William wants you, and
that you know the subject you are expected to handle. Your
credentials as President of the Society are and ought to be sufficient to
give you the status and authority you will need in your mission.
And if you go, I suppose you will not need to do so for two
months. Will you not then during the time get rid of your disease so
as to enable you the more effectively to do your work?
Naiker and Sundaram seem to be doing very well.

APPENDICES
APPENDIX I
THE GREAT MARCH
[VOLKSRUST,

November 8, 1913]
He [Gandhiji] left almost at once by motor to rejoin the marchers. Thus, if
there was an effort on Government’s part to put an end to the demonstration by
depriving the men of their leader in the hope that they would become discouraged and
abandon the attempt to reach the Rand, this effort has been completely stultified. I
shared the motor in which Messrs Kallenbach and Gandhi overtook the main body of
marchers about 33 miles from Volksrust. They were well on their way to Kromdraai
Station, near Standerton, which is their halt for the day. The narrow ribbon of road
which leads to the Rand passes through beautiful grassy country, and, as the weather
was pleasant, the strikers were walking easily and showed little fatigue. They were a
little beyond General Botha’s farm when the car overtook them, and there was
extraordinary enthusiasm as Mr. Gandhi alighted among them. The car had halted at
Paardekraal, where Mr. Gandhi spoke some encouraging words to the women. Old and
infirm men halted there, and Mr. Gandhi left some medicines which a doctor in
Newcastle had supplied. All along the road the car passed stragglers, who lined up and
saluted Mr. Gandhi, calling him “Bapoo”, or father.
THE RATIONS
Although the rations served out consist only of a pound-and-a-half loaf of
bread and an ounce of sugar per man, the marchers are cheerful and patient to an
extraordinary degree. They have the utmost confidence in Mr. Gandhi, and obey him
implicitly, although as a class indentured coal-miners and the like—they are totally
unused to discipline unaccompanied by force. As lieutenants, Mr. Gandhi has several
young Johannesburg Indians who were prominent during the former passive
resistance movement, and the mounted constables accompanying the marchers told
me they had orders to arrest some of these at Kromdraai and take them in to
Standerton.
Mr. Gandhi informs me that the passive resistance movement is diminishing
his resources by £250 a day, and that more than the present contribution of £3,000
per month will have to be sent from India if the success of the movement is to be
assured. He has, however, no doubt at all about the response from India. Apart from
the women at Charlestown, there are communities of strikers in every affected area to
be supported, and the cost of the march to the Rand is estimated at one shilling per
day per man. Volksrust bakers have received a contract for the supply of bread, which
is sent on each day by rail to an appointed station. The sugar is served out for its

462

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

sustaining properties, and amounts to about five packets a day in the aggregate. The
Indians make a hole in their loaves, into which they put their handfuls of sugar. Each
man carries a pannikin, which he fills with water as often as is possible. The
marchers had an unexpected treat at Paardekop, where last night tea was served to the
full 2,000 odd of them at the expense of a local Indian storekeeper. Mr. Gandhi
impressed upon them the fact that tea was not on the regular menu. Leaving Mr.
Gandhi with the passive resisters, whose leadership to the promised land he resumed,
Mr. Kallenbach and I returned to Volksrust, and passed about 13 miles from the town a
further band of 100 coolies, who crossed the border this morning with as little trouble
as their predecessors. Some of those who march to Johannesburg, I learn, are men
who were charged at Newcastle with breaking their indentures, and were released on
their own recognisances through lack of prison accommodation. They offered to
await trial if food and shelter were provided, but this the local Magistrate refused, and
so they departed to join in the march on Johannesburg.

APPENDIX II
EXTRACT FROM GENERAL BOTHA’S SPEECH 1
[NYLSTROOM,

November 1, 1913]
General Botha said he was sure there was only one road to befollowed in
dealing with the Asiatic question and that was the right road. He hoped people not
living in South Africa would realise that their altitude in regardto the Asiatic was not
prompted by a desire to get rid of Asiatics, but wasprompted by principle. In this
country they had Coloured races to deal withand they did not want to have the
position complicated any further. Their sole aim was to keep the position pure and
clean. Today he understood the Asiatics would undertake a great march from Newcastle
to Volksrust. He hoped these people would accept better advice than they were doing
today. General Smuts had recently made a statement as to what had taken place when
Mr. Gokhale was here. Mr. Gokhale had replied and made a different explanation of
what occurred. He (General Botha) wished to state that he was present at the interview
with Mr. Gokhale. It took place in his (General Botha’s) office, and the others
present were General Smuts, Mr. Fischer, and Mr. Gokhale. He only wished to say
that he agreed with and endorsed every word spoken by General Smuts in regard to that
interview, and in regard to what took place. “At any rate,” General Botha concluded,
“we shall do nothing by which your rights will suffer.”

This has been extracted from Governor-General’s despatch dated November
6, 1913, to the Colonial Office.
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

It will be observed that General Botha confirms the denial given by General
Smuts to the statement that the repeal of the £3 tax was definitely promised to Mr.
Gokhale.

APPENDIX III
POLAK’S LETTER TO LORD AMPTHILL 1
VOLKSRUST GAOL,

November 12, 1913
DEAR LORD AMPTHILL,

My present address will not surprise you after the cables that will have doubtless been sent home. The circumstances of my arrest you will see from Indian
Opinion. The whole affair, whilst partially accidental, is really taking advantage of
me on the part of the Government. I had joined Mr. Gandhi near Greylingstad, in order
to discuss a number of matters with him prior to my prospective departure for India on
Friday next. He was then marching at the head of 1500 of the £3 tax passive resisters
who had entered the Transvaal to court arrest, as the Government had refused
otherwise to deal with them and had left the heavy burden of feeding and otherwise
maintaining them upon us. I had received a warning from him that if I came to the
Transvaal from Natal, I might be arrested. In view of the fact that I, as an outsider, had
so often counselled Indian passive resisters to challenge arrest, I felt that it would be
highly dishonourable for me—an Englishman—to draw back before such a risk, and I
did not hesitate to join him. We had hardly been conversing half an hour before we
were met by a police sub-inspector and the Chief Immigration Officer, who arrested
Mr. Gandhi on a warrant from Dundee, charging him with removing indentured
Indians from Natal. He was driven away at once, and as these hundreds of people were
leaderless, did not know where their camping ground was for the night, or where they
were to get their rations next day, the authorities having refused the responsibility of
taking charge of them and providing for them, I had no option but to accept the
1

A copy of this was forwarded by Lord Ampthill to the Colonial Office on
December 5, along with a covering letter in which he observed, “I venture to think
that the Union Government of South Africa would have done better to invite the
leaders of the Indian community to confer with them instead of putting them in gaol
as there can be little doubt that under Mr. Gandhi’s leadership the struggle would have
been managed without disorder and with none of the injury which has since been
caused. I trust, however, that His Majesty’s Government have already suggested to the
authorities in South Africa that negotiation with Mr. Gandhi affords the most likely
means of arriving at a speedy solution of the difficulty.”

464

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

responsibility of leading the people to Greylingstad, where we camped on the open
veld for the night, and the next day to Balfour, about 13 miles beyond. Here the
police officer and the Chief Immigration Officer asked me to discuss the situation
with them. They informed me that they were instructed to order the arrest of all the
people as prohibited immigrants in the Transvaal and to deport them to Charlestown,
in Natal, where they would be arrested on local charges by the Natal authorities. They
asked me to co-operate with them in entraining the men so as to avoid disturbance and
the intervention of the squad of police that had arrived. I told them that, in the
circumstances, I would co-operate with them cordially, as they now assumed the
responsibility of feeding and sheltering the people, but that, had they not given me
that assurance, I was prepared to continue to march with the men until either they were
arrested or I, and I offered to place myself at their disposal for arrest then if they
desired to hold me. I hey replied that they had no desire whatever to do so and thanked
me for my offer of service. Later, when the people were arrested, some of the more
defiant spirits, who did not know me refused to entrain until they received the
instruction from Mr. Gandhi, and carrying the mass with them, they proceeded to
resume the march. I at once stood in front of them and urged them to remember their
status as passive resisters. Eventually I prevailed upon them to follow me to the
station where they all entrained peacefully. I am sure it would have been impossible
to entrain them had I not been present, and the men would probably have been goaded
into violent reprisals by police tactlessness and military brutality. I was specially
thanked by the police officials in charge and also, subsequently, by the magistrate
here. As I did not know exactly what might happen at Charlestown, and in order to
assist the authorities to keep order in case of need, I travelled down with the first
train. Shortly afterwards I was arrested and brought to Volksrust. Yesterday both Mr.
Kallenbach (whose name is no doubt well-known to Your Lordship—he is the owner
of Tolstoy Farm, where the passive resisters were maintained in the last struggle, a
German by nationality, a Jew, like myself, by religion, and an architect by
profession) and I were charged before the magistrate with aiding and abetting in the
introduction of prohibited immigrants into the Transvaal. A remand until tomorrow
was asked for by the prosecution. We were refused bail as we declined togive an
assurance that meanwhile we would take no further part in the movement. We are now
in prison awaiting trial, and expect to be convicted tomorrow. We shall probably get
about 3 months, but whether with or without hard labour I cannot say. We shall, of
course, refuse to pay the alternative fines.
I at once wired the circumstances to the Minister of the Interior, explaining
that I had intended to leave for India on Friday at Mr. Gokhale’s request, thus leaving
it to him to decide whether or not to proceed with the prosecution. He has replied that
the case should go on. I shall not, therefore, be going to India. May I suggest that a
representation on the subject may be made to the Imperial Government, pointing out
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

465

that, with the facts before them, the Union Government have prevented my joining
Mr. Gokhale a his request in order to assist him in placing the South African Indian
question fully before the Government of India.
I am sure that Your Lordship will agree that, in the circumstances in which I
suddenly found myself, I could not have adopted honourably any other course of
action than I did. In any other case, such influence as I have with the Indian
community would have at once disappeared.
I may add that the spread of the strike along the Coast, on the plantations, is
wholly spontaneous, and indeed, strongly against our advice as we did not wish it to
get beyond manageable proportions. But the Government must now bear the
responsibility.
Both Mr. Kallenbach and I are looking forward to an enviable period of repose
and irresponsibility. The strain of the last few weeks upon Mr. Gandhi especially and
ourselves has been tremendous and this withdrawal from public activity for the time
being will be a matter of real relief to us. Mr. Gandhi was sentenced at Dundee
yesterday to nine months hard labour, on three separate charges under the indenture
law. I am afraid that, meanwhile, until my release, Your Lordship must derive your
news of the movement from Indian Opinion.
With kind regards,
Yours very truly,

(1) LETTER FROM MINISTER OF INTERIOR
PRETORIA,

December 24, I913
GENTLEMEN,

Your letter, which was dated 21st instant and immediately communicated by
you to the Press, has only today reached the Department of the Interior and been seen
by the Minister.
I am instructed to reply at once that the Minister is uable to accept the
conditions on which you propose to give evidence before the Commission appointed
by the Government and to suspend passive resistance pending the Commission’s
finding, particularly the condition which involves the appointment of additional
members to the Commission in the interests of the Indian community. The
Commission was intended to be impartial and judicial in character, and in
constituting it the Government consulted neither the Indian community nor the
Coal-owners and Sugar Planters’ Association of Natal, nor could the Government for a
moment, by following the course you propose, give colour to the unwarranted

468

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

reflections you make on two of the Commissioners appointed.
The course you propose to pursue is noted and deeply regretted, not least so in
the interests of the Indian community, which cannot but be profoundly affected by the
lawless character of your procedure, the gratuitous infliction of grave sufferings on
the innocent, both white and Indian, and the consequent exasperation of public
opinion throughout the Union.

APPENDIX VI
LORD HARDINGE’S SPEECH1
A message from Madras states that the Viceroy (Lord Hardinge), in a speech in
reply to Indian addresses said the position of Indians in South Africa for some years
past had received the most anxious consideration of the Raj, which was doing all in
its power to ensure fair treatment.
He added: “The Union Act of which you complain has in practice the effect of
putting an end to Asiatic emigration to South Africa, though it does not discriminate
in so many words against Asiatics. We, however, have succeeded in securing the
privilege of entry for a limited number of educated Indians annually, and have also
specially endeavoured to secure as favourable terms as possible for the Indians already

resident in the Union. Our efforts have resulted in the inclusion of provisions for the
right of appeal to the Court on points of law and definition of domicile in accordance
with which the position of un-indentured Indians is satisfactorily laid down.
“We are at present in communication with Lord Crewe regarding other
restrictions in the Act to which you take exception and we trust our representations
will not be resultless. You urged retaliatory measures by the Raj, but it is not stated
what particular measures are adoptable. We forbade the emigration of indentured
Indians to Natal in 1911, and the Natal planters sent a delegate to India to beg for a
reconsideration of that decision. That shows how hardly the planters were hit by the
stoppage of that emigration, but I am afraid that it had little effect on South Africa as
a whole, and unfortunately it is not easy to find means whereby India can make its
indignation felt by those holding the reins of Government in South Africa.
“Recently your compatriots in South Africa have taken matters into their own
hands, organising passive resistance to laws which they consider invidious and
unjust, an opinion which we, who are watching their struggles from afar, cannot but
share. They violated those laws with a full knowledge of the penalties involved,
and are ready with all courage and patience to endure the penalties. In all this they
have the deep and burning sympathy of India and also of those who, like myself,
without being Indians, sympathise with the people of this country, but the most
recent developments have taken a most serious turn. We have seen the widest
publicity given to allegations that passive resistance is dealt with by measures which
would not be tolerated for a moment in any country claiming to be civilised. These
allegations were met by a categorical denial by the responsible Government of South
Africa, though even the denial contains admissions which do not seem to me to
indicate that the Government exercised a very wise discretion in some of the steps it
adopted. That is the position for the moment. I feel that if the South African
Government desires to justify itself in the eyes of India and the world, the only course
open is to appoint a strong impartial committee, whereon Indian interests will be
represented, to conduct the most searching inquiry, and you may rest assured that the
Raj will not cease to urge these considerations on the Imperial Government.”

(2) EXTRACT FROM GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S DESPATCH2
PRETORIA,

December 31, 1913
You will observe that Mr. Gandhi’s present attitude is less unreasonable than
that which he adopted in his public utterances immediately after his liberation.
General Smuts is still considering his reply to Mr. Gandhi’s latest proposals, and I
think it not improbable that he will agree to grant a personal interview as requested. I
doubt, however, whether Mr. Gandhi’s suggestions with regard to the constitution of
the Commission will be found acceptable. The addition of two members, nominated

This referred to an erroneous report about the movement of a group of
Indians collected at Pinetown, near Durban, on January l, the date originally
announced by Gandhiji for the resumption of the march into the Transvaal. It later
transpired that the group acted in ignorance of Gandhiji’s declaration that Passive
Resistance would not be resumed on New Year Day.

This formed part of a despatch forwarding to the Colonial Office copies of
correspondence between Gandhiji and the Minister of the Interior, and clippings from

respectively by the Indian community and by the employers of Indian labour, would
destroy the judicial character of the Commission, and this would probably entail the
resignation of Sir William Solomon. The alternative proposal that the Commission
should be converted into a single-member Commission, consisting only of Sir
William Solomon, is not open to the same objection, and neither Mr. Esselen nor
Colonel Wylie would probably show any disinclination to resign their membership.
It would not, however, be easy for the Government so to reconstitute its own
Commission at Mr. Gandhi’s bidding without seeming to admit that the two members
whose elimination is asked for were in fact not wholly impartial. Possibly if General
Smuts and Mr. Gandhi meet, their combined ingenuity may succeed in discovering
some way out of the difficulty.
On Monday last General Smuts told my Secretary in confidence that he had
received a private letter from Sir William Solomon expressing regret at the bad use
which Mr. Gandhi, Mr. Polak and Mr. Kallenbach had made of their liberty, and
intimating that if the Commission were to be boycotted by the Indians, in whose
interests it had been appointed, it was unlikely that the enquiry could prove anything
but one-sided. Sir William went on to say that he had accepted appointment, much
against his own personal inclinations, only from a sense of duty because it had been
represented to him that by acting as Chairman he would have an opportunity of
rendering a public service. As it now seemed likely that the Commission would be
unable to do any useful work, he was inclined to doubt whether there was any reason
why he should continue to serve. General Smuts said that he proposed in his reply to
point out the distinction between abstention by the Indians from giving evidence and
a renewal of passive resistance, strikes and lawlessness. If recourse were again had to
disorder, the question whether the enquiry should be proceeded with might arise.
If, however, the Indians confined themselves simply to a policy of abstention
from giving evidence, the Commission would still be able to hear official and
other European witnesses upon the incidents of the strike and the allegations of
ill-treatment, and to consider the general question of grievances from the
documentary material which could be laid before it by the Government. It was
desirable, moreover, that the official witness who was being sent by the Government
of India should be afforded an opportunity of being heard. General Smuts seemed to
hope that these arguments would induce Sir William Solomon to continue to serve. He
was evidently apprehensive lest Mr. Gandhi should be enabled to enhance his
prestige by the personal triumph of breaking up a Government Commission of whose
constitution he happened to disapprove.

APPENDIX IX
STATEMENT ISSUED BY G. K. GOKHALE
[December 31, 1913]
In view of the anxiety prevailing in the country as to the position of matters
in South Africa and the inquiries that are being addressed to me on the subject, I think
it necessary to publish the following statement:
On 18th December, I received at Calcutta a cablegram from the Natal Indian
Association stating that there was a strong feeling among Indians in South Africa not
to accept the Commission of inquiry appointed on account of two members out of
three being known to be hostile to the community and asking for my advice as to
what should be done. Mr. Gandhi and other passive resistance leaders were then in jail
and there was at that time no indication of the lines on which the Commission
proposed to work. It was impossible for me in the circumstances to offer any definite
advice and after hurriedly consulting two distinguished friends in Calcutta, who were
within easy reach, I cabled back to say that the course to be adopted should depend on
the strength of feeling of the community and the advice of friendly Europeans in
South Africa; and I asked the Association to weigh carefully which course would do
greater harm to the cause, viz., abstention from offering evidence or participation in
the proceedings under protest, adding that I would cable again from Bombay after
consulting Sir Pherozeshah Mehta. I left Calcutta that same day and arrived in
Bombay on the 20th, when I read in the papers a summary of Sir William Solomon’s
opening statement, as also news about the release of Mr. Gandhi and other passive
resistance leaders. As Reuter had stated that the released leaders had proceeded to
Pretoria to see the Ministers, I naturally concluded that the Union Government was
desirous of arriving at some understanding with the community and that Mr. Gandhi’s
reported visit to Pretoria was in connection with some negotiations that had already
been started. I immediately put myself into telegraphic communication with Mr.
Gandhi and during the last ten days numerous cables have passed between us. It is not
possible to publish all these cables, but I think I may state that in the course of these
communications every effort was made to press on Mr. Gandhi the view which clearly
is now gaining ground in this country, viz., that after Sir William Solomon’s speech,
the release of the leaders and the recognition given to the Commission by the
Government of India by the deputation of Sir Benjamin Robertson, it would be a
tactical mistake to boycott the Commission as forgoing an important opportunity
secured after great difficulty to state the Indian case before the whole world and likely
to alienate from the cause influential support both in this country and in England. Mr.
Gandhi, however, finds himself unable to act on this view unless the Union

476

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

Government modify in some manner the constitution of the Commission and release
all passive resisters at present in jail, as he and the Indian community stand bound by
a solemn oath not to accept the Commission except on these terms. This is the
situation at present. Meanwhile Sir Benjamin Robertson starts for South Africa on
1st January. As it is necessary that the country should clearly understand Mr.
Gandhi’s position, I asked him to cable to me for publication a full statement of that
position. This statement into which are incorporated some of his previous cables is
as follows: Mr. Gandhi says: We were discharged unconditionally on 18th instant on
the recommendation of the Commission. We were not told at the time of our release
why we were being released. It is not true that after release we went to Pretoria to see
the Ministers. Knowing what we do of the feelings of Mr. Esselen and Col. Wylie
towards Indians, it is impossible for us not to feel strongly that the Commission has
not been appointed to give us fair play, but it is a packed body intended to hoodwink
the Government and the public both in England and in India. The Chairman’s
integrity and impartiality is undoubted, but Mr. Esselen and Col. Wylie are
well-known and admitted generally to be amongst the strongest and most violent
opponents of Indians in South Africa. Mr. Esselen has emphatically declared from
public platforms on many occasions extreme anti-Asiatic views, and he is so
intimately related politically to Union Ministers that he is regarded here practically
as a non-official member of the Ministry. Only recently he expressed himself
privately most offensively about the Indians to a member of the Union Parliament,
named Mr. Meyler, who has publicly protested against his appointment. Col. Wylie
has been our bitterest opponent in Natal for more than twenty years. So far back as
1896 he led a mob to demonstrate against the landing of Indians who had arrived at
Durban in two vessels, advocated at a public meeting the sinking of the ships with all
Indians on board and commending a remark made by another speaker that he would
willingly put down one month’s pay for one shot at the Indians, asked how many
were prepared to put down similarly a month’s pay on those terms. And he has
consistently been our enemy all these years. Moreover he is colonel of the defence
force whose acts are the subject of inquiry and ho is also legal adviser of many estate
owners and during present agitation he has openly said that the £3 tax ought not to be
repealed. Commission is not merely judicial but also political, investigating not
only facts as to ill-treatment, but also recommending policy for the future, and it is
impossible that the Chairman will control the views of his colleagues in matters of
policy. To appoint Messrs Esselen and Wylie to investigate our grievances and to
stigmatize our protests against their appointment as an unwarranted reflection on
their impartiality is to add insult to injury. Almost entire South African Press admits
reasonableness of our suggestions as to additional members, and several influential
ministers of religion and other European friends are working to remove present
deadlock and secure us fair play. We would be prepared to lead evidence before Sir
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

477

William Solomon alone if it was a question merely of inquiring into charges of
flogging, acts of military and other ill-treatment, but this inquiry includes an
examination of grievances also. Before our release public meetings had been held at
all Indian centres throughout South Africa protesting strongly against the personnel
of the Commission and urging the appointment of Mr. Schreiner and Judge
Rose-Innes to counterbalance Messrs Esselen and Wylie. Immediately on our release
as soon as we took the situation in, we addressed a letter to the Ministry asking for
these additions to the Commission. Objection has been taken to the form in which
this request was put forward by us, but we are confronted with a terrible crisis and it is
not easy always to weigh carefully niceties of form at such a juncture. Indian position
always has been to insist on the community being consulted at least informally
regarding matters vitally affecting it since it is voteless. In constituting present
Commission Indian sentiment not only was not consulted but was contemptuously
trampled on. During recent deadlock in connection with European railwaymen’s
grievances the men were permitted to choose their nominee by a referendum. We
merely ask for informal consultation. When we were released, we found that the
indignation of our countrymen was at white heat owing to floggings which they had
seen with their own eyes, shooting which they believed to be unjustified, and other
acts of ill-treatment; and this indignation was further intensified by the harrowing
accounts of prison treatment which passive resisters, including ladies, who were
released at this time on the expiry of their sentences, gave to the community. In all
our experience of prison treatment in this country, never have we been treated before
with such unparalleled cruelty. Insults by warders, frequent assaults by Zulu warders,
withholding of blankets and other necessary articles, food badly cooked by Zulus, all
these necessitated a hunger-strike causing immense suffering. You have to know
these things, to understand the frame of mind in which the community met in public
meeting on Sunday 21st December to consider the position and resolve on future
action. l here was but one feeling at the meeting and that was that if we had any
self-respect we must not accept the Commission unless it was modified in some
manner in favour of the Indians, and we must also ask for the release of all real
passive resister-prisoners, in which term we do not include persons rightly convicted
of actual violence. And we all took a solemn oath in God’s name that unless these
conditions were complied with, we would resume our passive resistance. Now this
oath we mean to keep whatever happens. In this struggle we are fighting with
spiritual weapons, and it is not open to us to go back on our solemn declarations.
Moreover, in this matter it is not as though it is the leaders that are egging the
community on. On the contrary, so determined is the community to keep the vow
which it has solemnly taken that if any leaders ventured to advise the acceptance of
the Commission without any modification on the lines asked for, they would beyond
all doubt be killed, and I must add justly so. I believe we are gaining ground. Several

478

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

influential Europeans, including some ministers of religion, recognizing the justice
of our stand, are working to help us and we have not yet given up the hope that some
way may be found out of the difficulty. In all this crisis, I wish to say before
concluding, two things have greatly sustained and comforted us. One is the splendid
courage and staunch advocacy of our cause by His Excellency the Viceroy and the
other is the hearty support which India has sent us. We shall do nothing now till Sir
Benjamin Robertson arrives and we shall receive him with all honour and trust, both
because you tell us we shall find in him a strong friend and also because he has been
appointed by the Viceroy to whom we feel so profoundly grateful. But unless the
Commission is made in some way more acceptable to us, I do not see how renewal of
passive resistance can be avoided. We know it will entail enormous suffering, assure
you we do not desire it, but neither shall we shrink from it, if it must become.
The Times of India, 1-1-1914.

APPENDIX X
EXTRACT FROM GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S DESPATCH
PRETORIA,

January 22, 1914
Subsequently in the course of confidential conversation General Smuts
intimated to me that practically no difficulty would be presented by Mr. Gandhi’s two
administrative points, and very little by the point on the marriage question, if the
sense of Mr. Gandhi’s proposal thereon had been correctly apprehended. The
abolition of the £3 tax would be a much more formidable task, but he was disposed to
think that it would in the end be found inevitable. In substance therefore Mr. Gandhi
could probably be met; on the question of form, however, he did not see his way clear
to compliance with Mr. Gandhi’s wishes. If in regard to policy he were to ignore the
Commission appointed by the Government and to make a compact with Mr. Gandhi
after all that had occurred recently, he and his colleagues would be placed in a most
undignified and, he feared, even impossible position. At the same time, if a
settlement which would be accepted by all parties as final was attainable, he would
like to effect it without unnecessary delay by carrying the requisite legislation during
the forthcoming Session. He doubted whether he would be able to carry such
legislation unless he were fortified by a recommendation of the Commission, and
equally whether a recommendation would be obtainable in time if evidence were to be
led on every Indian grievance which could conceivably be brought forward. From this
point of view matters would not be advanced by the acceptance of Mr. Gandhi’s
second alternative, viz., the addition of Sir James Rose-Innes or Mr. Schreiner to the
Commission, even if there were no serious objections to such a course on other
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

479

grounds. He was in favour of limiting the enquiry of the Commission on questions of
policy to the four points specified by Mr. Gandhi, if this could be done without
making an overt bargain with him.
After further consideration and consultation of the Cabinet, General Smuts
signified his decision to Sir Benjamin Robertson for communication to Mr. Gandhi.
Its purport was that the Government could not see their way to alter either the
composition or the terms of reference of the Commission, nor could they authorize
him to make a compact with Mr. Gandhi by giving in advance of the Commission’s
report the assurances for which he had asked. The Commission must go on as
previously arranged, but it would be asked to submit its recommendations in regard to
policy at a sufficiently early date to enable legislation to be introduced during the
forthcoming Session. If Mr. Gandhi felt himself precluded by his vow from giving
evidence under these conditions, he was quite at liberty to abstain from participation
in its proceedings; he need, however, feel no serious apprehensions as to the
probable nature of the Commission’s recommendations on his four points and as to
the Government’s intentions, but he should promise not to revive passive resistance
until the Commission had reported and the Government had been given an
opportunity of taking action on the report. The Minister repeated that while he had
no knowledge whatever of Colonel Wylie’s views he had some little time ago sounded
both the Chairman and Mr. Esselen and felt sure that their recommendations would be
satisfactory to Mr. Gandhi.
In the result of the ensuing interviews and negotiations an understanding
which is embodied in the enclosed correspondence of yesterday’s date, was finally
reached by the Minister and Mr. Gandhi. You will observe that, while Mr. Gandhi
receives no assurances, the Government expressed their desire for an early settlement.
Mr. Gandhi and his friends will not appear before the Commission, but in recognition
of the opportunities of consultation which General Smuts had afforded by consenting
to receive Mr. Gandhi, they offer to assist Sir Benjamin Robertson in the preparation
of his evidence. Passive resistance is to be suspended pending the report of the
Commission and the introduction of legislation. The release of bona fide passive
resisters now serving sentence is asked for, and the Minister explains that this had
already been done by the Government. At his own suggestion, Mr. Gandhi and his
friends will take no further action with regard to the allegations of ill-treatment
during the Indian strike. The Government while repudiating the allegations as
emphatically as ever will also refrain from leading evidence upon them, but reserve
their right to ask the Commission to investigate the shooting affrays at Esperanza
and Mount Edgecombe. It will be noted that Mr. Gandhi has added to his previous four
points a fifth, asking for an assurance of just administration of the law and of due
regard to vested rights. This appears to be innocuously vague and should not cause

480

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

any difficulty. He has also slightly modified his stipulation respecting the licence
under Natal Act 17 of 1895. He formerly asked that a standing licence should be
substituted for the annual licence, but he now apparently contemplates that after an
ex-indentured Indian has acquired domiciliary rights, in terms of the judgment in the
Subrayen case, by three years continuous residence after the expiration of his
indentures, the licence should be dropped altogether. This is a point of detail on
which the Commission’s recommendation will doubtless carry weight with the
Government. I may mention that yesterday afternoon, when Mr. Gandhi received Mr.
Gorges’ letter, he was much perturbed by the omission of any explicit recognition of
the motive which restrained him from pursuing the allegations of ill-treatment. In
order to meet his difficulty, General Smuts caused the words which now form the third
sentence of the letter to be inserted. They were suggested by Mr. Gandhi himself, and
he is understood to be satisfied1 and to be leaving for Natal today.

APPENDIX XI
LETTER FROM MINISTER OF INTERIOR
PRETORIA,

January 21, 1914
SIR,

With reference to your letter of even date I am instructed by the Minister of the
Interior to reply that you are correct in your statement that it is not proposed to make
any alteration either in the personnel of, or the reference to, the Commission
appointed to enquire into the recent Indian Strike in Natal. The Minister regrets but of
course understands that you are so far committed by your previous public declarations
in regard to the Commission that you are precluded from appearing before it. He also
recognizes the motive which makes you unwilling to revive old sores by courting
libel proceedings before another tribunal.
The Government repudiates as strongly and emphatically as heretofore the
charges of harsh or improper action against the Indian passive resisters and strikers.
But as you and your friends have decided not to appear before the Commission and
lead evidence in support of those allegations, it seems likely that there will be no
charges for the Commission to investigate. The Government would regret the
consequent absence of an opportunity to lead rebutting evidence in vindication of the

481

conduct of its officers, but it feels that, unless it has a definite case to answer, any
attempt to deal with the allegations before the Commission could only result in an
unprofitable waste of time. The Government is anxious that any recommendations
which the Commission may make on the larger issue of Indian grievances should be
received at a sufficiently early date to enable proposals to be submitted to Parliament
during the forthcoming Session. It is hoped that those proposals, if accepted by
Parliament, would ensure a satisfactory and permanent settlement. The Government
considers that such a settlement of long standing disputes is too important to justify
any risk of endangering its achievement by delaying the proceedings of the
Commission—already delayed through unforeseen circumstances—by an enquiry,
which would now be necessarily one-sided, into points of minor and secondary
moment relatively to the wider issues at stake. If, therefore, the Indians decline to
submit to the Commission any specific charges in connection with the treatment of
passive resisters and strikers during the recent troubles, the Government will not
think it necessary to take any further action in refutation of the allegations against it
and its officers, but it reserves its right to ask the Commission to investigate the
occurrences which resulted in loss of life at Esperanza and Mount Edgecombe.
With reference to your prayer for the release of bona fide passive resistance
strikers from ordinary or compound gaols, the Department of Justice had already
previous to the arrival of your letter taken steps for the release of the small balance of
these prisoners kept in the gaols.
In regard to the grievances which you have summarised at the end of your
letter, the Government will, as already stated, await the recommendations of the
Commission before taking any action.
I have the honour to be,
Sir,
Your obedient servant,

APPENDIX XII
ANDREWS’ INTERVIEW WITH GOVERNOR-GENERAL1
[PRETORIA,

January 13, 1914]
I saw Mr. Andrews quite privately on Tuesday and had a long talk with him. He
impressed me favourably and appeared to have an exceptionally intimate acquaintance
with the working of Mr. Gandhi’s mind. He said that Mr. Gandhi makes two crucial
demands ( I ) the recognition of one wife as having a legal status, (2) the repeal of the
£3 tax. Importance was also attached but to a lesser degree to some agreement being
arrived at which restored the right of unrestricted admission into the Cape Province
enjoyed by South Africa-born Indians under the Cape Immigration Act. Mr. Andrews
assured me that Mr. Gandhi would make no claim whatever to equal franchise rights,
and fully accepted the policy of exclusion of Asiatics from South Africa. According to
Mr. Andrews, Mr. Gandhi is prepared to accept the Commission in so far as enquiry
into disturbances is concerned. If his political conditions are accepted, it would be a
solution of the position and there would be no necessity for any further work by the
Commission. If they were not accepted, a very difficult question would arise for Mr.
Gandhi had, with several compatriots, taken a vow not to recognize the Commission
unless he was met on his basic points. I said that personally I saw little difficulty in
conceding what Mr. Andrews stated Mr. Gandhi required. But Ministers might not feel
able to give unconditinal promises because the political situation might prevent
giving absolute guarantees that the remedial Act could be passed. Mr. Andrews said
that he feared Mr. Gandhi’s vow would prove an insuperable obstacle. I suggested
that Mr. Gandhi could give evidence as regards the disturbances as he expresses
readiness to do this. He could then by leave address the Court, state his conditions,
giving arguments and say that while fully accepting the capacity and authority of the
Commission to decide on questions of fact, he reserved to himself and his colleagues
absolute discretion to take their own courses on matters of political principle, and
concerning his own conscience. He hoped that the Commission would arrive at a
right judgment but that neither he nor his colleagues could give further evidence. Mr.
Andrews said that this gave a ray of light. Nothing could shake Mr. Gandhi on
matters of conscience. The vow might still create great difficulty. Mr. Gandhi’s life,
on a former occasion, had been attempted in Johannesburg by two Pathans because,
after taking a vow, he had come to an agreement. But he would do his best to induce
Mr. Gandhi to take this course if the Government assurances were not satisfactory.

He said further that, while Sir Benjamin Robertson was an excellent official, he
would not understand the subtle and sensitive working of Mr. Gandhi’s mind. I have
given this information to General Smuts. How far Mr. Andrews correctly interprets
Mr. Gandhi’s views I cannot say, but if he speaks with accurate knowledge, the
situation looks more hopeful. The Government, moreover, are in a better position to
take a generous view than at any previous time. Their firm and courageous action in
dealing with the strike firmly establishes their authority and reputation which
various events had shaken. Mr. Gandhi’s action in holding his hand while the
Government were in difficulties has been much appreciated. If concessions are now
made to the British Indians, no one can allege that they are made under coercion. l
sincerely trust therefore that the outcome may be satisfactory.

APPENDIX XIII
EXETRACTS FROM SOLOMON COMMISSION REPORT
As the Bill based upon the recommendations of the Commission may be
published very soon, we do not propose to give many extracts from the Report.
Moreover, the full report is available at 9d. per copy in Cape Town. We give,
however, some of the salient points from it. We have not found it possible to
condense the exhaustive sketch of the marriage and the £3 questions. We have,
therefore, been obliged to content ourselves with merely giving the text of the
recommendations on these two points. The curious must search the Report itself. The
document occupies 38 foolscap pages from which we take the following:

ON THE C OMMUNITY’S ABSTENTION
Unfortunately the main object which the Commission had in view in
commending the release of Messrs Gandhi, Polak and Kallenbach was, to a great
extent, frustrated by the attitude taken up by these persons.
So far from assisting the Commission by placing before it the case for the
Indian community for the redress of alleged grievances and by collecting evidence in
support of the serious allegations of acts of violence committed upon persons
sentenced to imprisonment in connection with the strike, the leaders decided, on
various grounds which it is unnecessary to mention, entirely to ignore the
Commission. The result was that not only was the Indian community not represented
by counsel, but that, acting upon the advice given by Mr. Gandhi, no witnesses
appeared to substantiate the charges of violence.
Fortunately, during the latter end of our sitting, a few Indians, chiefly from the
Mahomedan section of that community, who represented the Natal Indian Congress,

484

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

did appear before us and gave evidence of considerable value and importance. At a
later stage of the enquiry, when the Commission sat in Cape Town from the 23rd to
the 27th February, several other Indians presented themselves who claimed to
represent various societies, three of them having travelled from the Transvaal for that
purpose. These persons were, we think, well advised to refuse to follow the advice
given by Mr. Gandhi to his fellow-countrymen to ignore the Commission. By
appearing and giving evidence they were able to give us important information on
certain subjects and, by doing so, they, in our opinion, rendered considerable service
to the Indian community.

ON THE C AUSES OF THE S TRIKE
The documentary evidence as contained in the various Blue Books which have
been placed at our disposal makes it clear that the strike was immediately due to
dissatisfaction on the part of the leaders of the Indian community with the provisions
of the Immigrants Regulation Act, 1913.
Being unable to obtain from the Minister what he considered to be satisfactory
assurances on these points, Mr. Gandhi deliberately decided to take the grave steps
which immediately led to the strike and to the subsequent disturbances which are the
subject of this enquiry. In his letter of the 28th September, which closed the
correspondence between the Minister and himself, he informs the former that the step
which he proposes to take “consists in actively, persistently and continually asking
those who are liable to pay the £3 tax to decline to do so and to suffer the penalties
for non-payment, and, what is more important, in asking those who are now serving
under indentures and who will, therefore, be liable to pay the £3 tax on completion of
the indentures, to strike work until the tax is withdrawn.”
This is the first occasion on which, in the course of the correspondence
already referred to mention was made of the £3 tax. It was a matter, however, on
which there can be no doubt that many of the Indians felt very strongly, and it had
been one of the chief subjects of discussion between the Union Government and Mr.
Gokhale when he visited South Africa in 1912. The feeling of the Indians on this
subject had been much aggravated by the statements made to them that the Union
Government had promised Mr. Gokhale that a Bill would be introduced in the next
session of Parliament to repeal the tax.
When, therefore, no such Bill was introduced and when, in addition, the
Government repudiated having made any promise to that effect, the result was that
there was grave disappointment, on the part of the Indian community, especially in
Natal. It is impossible for us in this enquiry to enter into the controversy which has
arisen on the subject of the promise alleged to have been made to Mr. Gokhale; it is
sufficient for our purpose to state that the Indians had been led to believe that such a

VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

485

promise had been made, and that, on failure to introduce the expected legislation,
there was considerable feeling on their part against the Government.
There were other matters affecting Indians which we were invited by certain
witnesses to investigate, but which, in our opinion, did not fall within the scope of
our reference. Our enquiry into alleged grievances is limited to those which in any
way contributed to the strike. We have no authority to investigate and to make
recommendations upon the general position of Indians in the Union, and the
disabilities under which they suffer.
There was one other subject, however, upon which, though we at first felt
some doubt as to whether it was within the terms of our reference, we ultimately
decided to hear evidence. Complaints were made that the laws of the Union, more
especially the Immigration and Licensing Acts, were being administered against
Indians in a harsh and unsympathetic manner. That was one of the subjects specially
referred to in a letter from Mr. Cachalia, the Chairman of the British Indian
Association, to the Secretary of the Interior, dated 12th August, 1913, and published
in Blue Book C.D. 7111, page 26, in which he formally notifies the Government
that the Indian Community proposes again to have recourse to passive resistance,
and in which he states that the struggle will be continued so long as, amongst other
things, “a spirit of generosity and justice does not pervade the administration of the
existing laws referred to herein.”
The same subject is referred to in other communications that took place
between the Indian leaders and the Government, and in his letter of the 21st January,
1914, in which Gandhi intimates to the Minister his intention not to take part in the
proceedings before the Commission, he sums up the points on which relief is
sought, as follows:
(1) The Orange Free State question
(2) The Cape Colony question
(3) The Marriage question
(4) Repeal of the £3 tax
(5) An assurance that existing laws, especially affecting Indians, will be
administered justly and with due regard to vested rights.
In view of these circumstances, we came to the conclusion that we were
justified in extending the scope of our enquiry so as to include an investigation into
the subject of the administration of the Immigration and Licensing Laws.
We feel bound, however, in view of the terms of reference, to limit our investigation to the five subjects specified above, and to eliminate from our enquiry such
questions as the following, which we were invited by various witnesses to consider:
(a)

486

That the Transvaal Laws prohibiting Asiatics from becoming the
THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

owners of fixed property and from acquiring rights under the Gold Law
should be repealed.
(b)

That it should be illegal for the Government to insert in grants and
leases of land in townships in the Transvaal a clause prohibiting the
transfer or sub-letting of the land to Asiatics;

(c)

Such general questions as the alleged want of proper educational
facilities for the children of Asiatics; their inability to carry firearms,
to ride in trams in the Transvaal, etc.

None of these matters in our opinion had any effect in bringing about the
strike, and most of them could only be dealt with by legislation and not by administrative action, so that we do not consider that they fall within the scope of our
enquiry.
That being so, we now proceed to discuss the five subjects set forth by Mr.
Gandhi in his final letter of the 21st January, 1914.

THE ORANGE F REE S TATE QUESTION
This has already been referred to, and, in view of the assurance given by the
Minister on the subject, it is somewhat difficult to understand why it has been
resuscitated. The only point that can be made regarding it is, that, inasmuch as under
Section 7 of the Act of 1913 educated Indians entering the Free State become subject
to Section 8 of Chapter 33 of the Free State Law Book, which amongst other things
requires that a declaration shall be made before a Resident Magistrate, and inasmuch
as it has been agreed by the Minister that no such declaration shall in future be
required, it might be advisable to amend Section 7 of the Act so as to make this
perfectly clear.

THE C APE ENTRY QUESTION
It is clear that, if the provisional settlement of 1911 did in fact safeguard the
existing rights of Indians, then in strict law there has been a breach of that
agreement. Unfortunately the terms of this settlement are not set forth specifically in
any formal document, but are to be gathered from two letters which passed between
the Private Secretary to the Minister and Mr. Gandhi on the 23rd April, 1911.
It has been pointed out that in the letter of the Private Secretary of the 22nd
April, there was no direct assurance that existing rights would be maintained, but
there is no doubt that Mr. Gandhi and the Indian community generally understood that
this was one of the terms of the settlement. This appears from many letters subsequently written by Mr. Gandhi to the Minister and specially from certain correspondence which took place between them in January and February, 1912, and subsequently in July and August, 1913. For example, in Mr. Gandhi’s letter of the 24th
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

487

August, 1913, he states specially that “the correspondence setting forth the provisional settlement of 1911 protected all existing rights of the British Indians”.
Statements to the same effect are made in other letters, and never on any occasion was
this claim repudiated by the Minister. In fact, a perusal of the correspondence leaves
the impression that this was common cause between the parties, and was never the
subject of controversy.
Then, if that be so, it follows that by restricting the entry of Indians born in
south Africa into the Cape Colony to those who can satisfy the educational
requirement of Act 30 of 1906, there has been a departure from the provisional
settlement of 1911. At the same time, it is clear from Mr. Gandhi’s own letters to the
Minister that there is very little substance in this alleged grievance.
Looking at the whole subject from a practical point of view, we have come to
the conclusion that no good purpose could be gained by recommending that this
shadowy grievance should be remedied by amending the Act of 1913, so as to restore
the right of South Africa-born Indians to enter the Cape without undergoing the
educational test therein provided.
Before leaving the subject we might refer to a point to which our attention was
directed by Sir Benjamin Robertson. Section 4, (2) (a) of the Act of 1913 which deals
with the educational requirements of the Cape and Natal Provinces, makes provision
for those who were, at the commencement of the Act, lawfully entitled to reside in any
Province. It was pointed out that the right conferred by that section would not strictly
avail any person who became lawfully entitled to reside in any Province after the Act
came into force, as for example, a child born, after the commencement of the Act, of
Indians domiciled in South Africa.
It is indeed difficult to see what good purpose is served by the inclusion in the
Section of the words “at the commencement of the Act,” and they might very well be
deleted.

ADMINISTRATION OF EXISTING LAWS
We have now reached the fifth and last of the alleged grievances which have been
formulated by Mr. Gandhi in his letter to the Minister of the 21st January, 1914,
in-which he requires “an assurance that the existing laws especially affecting Indians
will be administered justly and with due regard to vested rights.” The representations
which have been made to us on this subject deal mainly with the Immigration and
Licensing Acts, and, as already stated, we propose to confine ourselves to these
subjects.

THE IMMIGRATION ACT
The complaints against the administrative methods of the Immigration

488

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

Department were fairly numerous, chiefly in the Cape Colony. In respect of some of
them we were not satisfied that they have been established and we do not propose to
make any reference to such. There are others, however, in regard to which we are of
opinion that grievances do exist and we propose to deal with these as shortly as
possible.

THE LICENSING ACTS
Representations were made to the Commission regarding the administration of
the Acts with reference to the grant of licences to carry on trade or business in the
Cape Colony and in Natal.
We do not, however, see our way to making any recommendations on this
subject which are likely to be of any use.
No evidence was laid before us as to the administration of the licensing laws in
other towns of the Cape Colony or in the country districts, and we have, therefore, no
observations to make on that subject.
As regards Natal, the system is somewhat different from that which obtains in
the Cape Colony.
The evidence before us is to the effect that the Act is not so strictly
administered against Indians in the Natal boroughs as it is in Cape Town, but that it is
becoming more and more difficult for Indians to obtain new licences except in those
quarters of the town which are inhabited almost exclusively by them, and which may
be regarded as Asiatic reserves. In some other parts of the towns it is almost
impossible now for Indians to obtain new licences.
As regards the rest of Natal outside of the boroughs and townships, there is
one licensing officer who is a Government official, and from whose decision an
appeal lies to the licensing board. His policy towards Indians is far more liberal than
that of the licensing officers in the boroughs. In fact, he informs us that he makes no
distinctions between Europeans and Indians.
A fact of some interest which was elicited from this witness is that, where
applications for new licences are made by Indians, more than 50 per cent of the
objections come from other Indians.
We had no complaint regarding the grant of new licences from this licensing
officer, the complaints being directed entirely against the administration of the Act
in the boroughs and townships. We do not see our way, however, to make any
recommendations on this subject. Nothing can be done which would be of any effect
except by legislation, and, for the reasons already given when dealing with the grant
of licences in Cape Town, we are unable to suggest any amendment of the laws.
We have now dealt with all the grievances formulated by Mr. Gandhi in his

VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

489

letter to the Minister of the Interior, but before closing, we think that it is desirable
to summarise the various recommendations that appear in different parts of the report.
Some of these recommendations will require legislation to give effect to them
whilst others can be sufficiently dealt with by administrative action.
They are as follows:
(1) Section 5 (g) of the Immigration Regulation Act of 1913 should be
amended so as to bring the law into conformity with the practice of the Immigration
Department, which is: “To admit one wife and minor children by her of an Indian now
entitled to reside in any Province, or who may in the future be permitted to enter the
Union, irrespective of the fact that his marriage to such wife may have been
solemnised according to tenets that recognise polygamy, or that she is one of several
wives married abroad so long as she is his only wife in South Africa.”
(2) Instructions should be given to the Immigration Officer to open registers
in each Province for the registration by Indians of, say, three or more years’ residence
in South Africa, who have at present, or have had in the past, more than one wife
living with them in South Africa, of the names of such wives, who are to be free to
travel to and from India with the minor children so long as the husband continues to
reside in this country.
(3) There should be legislations on the lines of Act 16 of 1860 of the Cape
Colony making provision for the appointment of marriage officers from among the
Indian priests of different denominations for the purpose of solemnising marriages in
accordance with the respective religions of the parties.
(4) There should be legislation for the validation by registration of existing de
facto monogamous marriages, by which is understood the marriage of one man with
one woman, under a system which recognizes the right of the husband to marry one or
more other wives.
(5) Section 6 of Act 17 of 1895 of Natal which requires certain Indians to take
out year by year a pass or licence to remain in the Colony and which provides for the
payment of £3 a year for such licence should be repealed.
(6) Conditions under which identification certificates under the Immigrants
Regulation Act of 1913 are issued should be amended so as to provide that such
certificates shall remain in force for a period of three years instead of one year.
(7) An Interpreter should be attached to the office of the Immigration
Department in Cape Town who should be a whole-time officer.
(8) Application forms for permits, certificates, etc., from the Immigration
Department should be filled in by the clerk in the office upon information supplied to
him by the applicant, if the latter so desires.
(9) The practice at present existing in the Cape Town office of this Department

490

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

of taking in certain cases prints of all the fingers of both hands, instead of the
thumbs only, should be discontinued.
(10) The Resident Magistrate of a district in which there is no immigration
officer should have authority to issue temporary permits to Indians residing in his
district who desire to travel from the Province in which they are living to another
Province of the Union.
(11) The present fee of £1 for an identification certificate or temporary permit should be materially reduced, and no charge should be made for any
extension.
(12) The present practice of the immigration officer of one Province of
communicating by telegraph with the immigration officer of another Province, when
an application is made by an Indian for a permit to travel from one Province to the
other, should be discontinued.
(13) Domicile certificates which have been issued to Indians in Natal
by the immigration officer of that Province, and which bear the thumb impression of the holder of the permit should be recognized as conclusive evidence
of the right of the holder to enter the Union as soon as his identity has been
established.
(14) An arrangement should, if possible, be made with the Government of
India for the holding of official inquiries by the magistrate or other Government
official in the case of women ant children proceeding from India to join their
husbands and fathers in South Africa. If, on inquiry, the official is satisfied that the
woman and children are the wife and children of the man in South Africa whom they
claim as husband or father, a certificate should be given by him to that effect, and
such certificate should be treated by the immigration officer as conclusive evidence of
the facts stated in it.

APPENDIX XV
EXTRACT FROM GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S DESPATCH
CAPE TOWN ,

June 5, 1914
In my despatch Secret of the 30th ultimo I had the honour to report that Mr.
Gandhi was about to have an interview with General Smuts for the purpose of
discussing the points which he had raised upon the draft Indians’ Relief Bill, and upon
certain administrative questions. The interview took place on Saturday last. I
understand that General Smuts suggested to Mr. Gandhi that, in view of the more
immediate urgency of the Bill, the points connected with it should be taken first, and
the administrative questions allowed to stand over for a short time until the Minister
should have a little more leisure for their consideration. To this suggestion Mr.
Gandhi appears to have agreed. The result of the interview was that General Smuts
acceptedMr. Gandhi’s representations upon the three legislative points specified in
the third paragraph of my above-mentioned despatch, and gave instructions for the
necessary amendments to be made in the text of the Bill prior to its introduction in
the House of Assembly.
2. You will have learnt from my telegram of the 3rd instant that the Bill was
introduced and read a first time on Tuesday last, and was set down for second reading
on Monday the 8th instant. The variations from the original text have also been
communicated to you by cablegram. Copies of the Bill as introduced accompany my
despatch No. 362 of the 5th instant.
3. Mr. Gandhi’s wishes have been met by the elimination from 2(1)(a) of the
words “at the commencement of this Act”, and the substitution of the word “exists”
for the word “existed”. The word “then” has been retained before the word
“recognized” but I am not aware whether this retention is deliberate or due to an
oversight. I am enquiring into the point, but in any case it does not seem to be one to
which importance need be attached. The paragraph in its present form restores the

492

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

privileges in regard to the registration of Indian marriages which were provided in the
last type-written draft, as enclosed with my despatch Secret No. 4 of the 16th ultimo.
By a further amendment of Clause 2(1), the words “Magistrate or” have been inserted
on page 2, line 25 of the new print. Thereby all Magistrates will be enabled to
register Indian marriages under Clause 2, irrespective of the circumstance whether or
not they also hold appointment as marriage officers. This meets Mr. Gandhi’s second
point. His third (relating to the admission of the children of a deceased woman who,
had she lived, would have been eligible under Clause 3 for exemption from
restriction) is met by the introduction of the words following the word “defined” on
page 4, line 33 of the new print.
4. I have reason to believe that General Smuts is anxious to complete the
second reading stage as soon as possible. It is to be hoped, therefore, that the Bill
will not be crowded out by financial business on Monday. Considerable opposition
from Natal members on both sides of the House is anticipated. Sir Thomas Smartt and
other prominent Unionist members may be expected to give the Bill a helping hand.
There are no indications at present as to the attitude which the Hertzogites and the
Labour party are likely to adopt.

APPOINTMENT OF MARRIAGE OFFICER TO SOLEMNIZE MARRIAGES ACCORDING
TO THE RITES OF AN INDIAN RELIGION
l. (1) The Minister of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as Minister) may
from time to time appoint priests of any Indian religion to be marriage officers with
authority to solemnize the marriages of Indians in accordance with the rites and
formularies of such religion.
(2) A marriage between two Indians solemnized in accordance with such rites
and formularies by a marriage officer so appointed shall be a valid and binding
marriage, and all the incidents shall follow therefrom which follow from any other
union recognized in law as a valid and binding marriage.
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

493

(3) A marriage officer appointed under this section shall be under the same
obligations of keeping registers and entering therein particulars of marriages
solemnized by him as are imposed upon marriage officers appointed under any other
law in force in the Province in which those marriages are solemnized and the
provisions of any such law as to the custody and inspection of registers, the
obtaining of copies thereof, the evidence of certified copies thereof, the loss, the
destruction or falsification of or injury to such registers or such certified copies shall
be deemed to be incorporated in this section.
VALIDATION BY REGISTRATION OF MARRIAGES WHICH IN FACT A RE M ONOGAMOUS
2.

(1) If any Indian male and Indian female upon a joint application to any
magistrate or marriage officer (whether appointed under this Act or
under any other law) satisfy such officer:

(a)

That there exists between them a union recognised as a marriage under
the tenets of an Indian religion which they profess; and

(b)

That there does not exist between either of them and any other person a
union so recognised as a marriage or any union recognized in law as a
marriage; and

(c)

That each of them is desirous that the union should be regarded as a
valid and binding marriage in law,

such officer shall, upon being furnished with particulars as to the full name, residence, place of birth, and age of each party and such further particulars as are prescribed
by regulations made under this section, register such union in manner so prescribed,
as a marriage between those parties. Notwithstanding that by the tenets of the
religion which the parties profess polygamous unions are approved or recognised,
the said union shall, by the fact of registration, become, as from the date when it was
contracted, a valid and binding marriage between the parties, and all the incidents
shall follow therefrom which follow from any other union recognised in law as a valid
and binding marriage, and the marriage shall be deemed to have taken place at the
place where the union was, prior to the registration, contracted.
(2) The Minister may make regulations as to the manner in which applications
shall be made under this section, the keeping of registers for the purposes thereof,
and the particulars to be entered in those registers. The provisions of the marriage
laws in force in the Province in which such unions are registered as marriages, so far
as those laws relate to the custody and inspection of registers, the obtaining of
copies thereof or extracts thereform, the evidence of certified copies thereof, the loss,
destruction or falsification of or injury to those registers certified copies or extracts
shall mutatis mutandis apply to registers kept under this section.

VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

495

to any port in India (with or without free conveyance by rail to such first mentioned
port) for any Indian (other than an Indian who is or may become entitled under Law
No. 25 of 1891—Natal—or any amendment thereof to such free passage) who makes a
written request for such free passage and—
(a)

Signs as a condition of the grant of such request a statement that he
abandons on behalf of himself and his wife and all minor children (if
any) all rights possessed by him or them to enter or reside in any part
of the Union together with all rights incidental to his or their domicile
therein; and

(b)

Furnishes to an officer designated by the Minister such means of
identification of such Indian and his wife and minor children (if any) as
the Minister may prescribe.

A condition so signed shall be conclusive evidence that such Indian and his

APPENDIX XVII
LETTER FROM E. M. GORGES
CAPE TOWN ,

June 30, 1914
DEAR MR. GANDHI,

Adverting to the discussions you have lately had with General Smuts on the
subject of the position of the Indian community in the Union, at the first of which
you expressed yourself as satisfied with the provisions of the Indians’ Relief Bill and
accepted it as a definite settlement of the points, which required legislative action, at
issue between that community and the Government; and at the second of which you
submitted for the consideration of the Government a list of other matters requiring
administrative action, over and above those specifically dealt with in that Bill; I am
desired by General Smuts to state with reference to those matters that:
(1)

He sees no difficulty in arranging that the Protector of Indian
Immigrants in Natal will in future issue to every Indian, who is subject
to the provisions of Natal Act 17 of 1895, on completion of his period
of indenture, or re-indenture, a certificate of discharge, free of charge,
similar in form to that issued under the provisions of Section 106 of
Natal Law No. 25 of 1891.

(2)

On the question of allowing existing plural wives and the children of
such wives to join their husbands (or fathers) in South Africa, no
difficulty will be raised by the Government if, on enquiry, it is found,
as you stated, that the number is a very limited one.

(3)

In administering the provisions of Section (4) (1) (a) of the Union
Immigrants’ Regulation Act, No. 22 of 1913, the practice hitherto
existing at the Cape will be continued in respect of South Africa-born
Indians who seek to enter the Cape Province, so long as the movement
of such persons to that Province assumes no greater dimensions than
has been the case in the past; the Government, however, reserve the
right, as soon as the number of such entrants sensibly increase, to
apply the provisions of the Immigration Act.

(4)

In the case of the “specially exempted educated entrants into the
Union” (i.e., the limited number who will be allowed by the
Government to enter the Union each year for some purpose connected
with the general welfare of the Indian community), the declarations to
be made by such persons will not be required at Provincial borders, as

VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

497

the general declarations which are made in terms of Section 19 of the
Immigrants’ Regulation Act at the port of entry are sufficient.
(5)

Those Indians who have been admitted within the last three years,
either to the Cape province or Natal, after passing the education tests
imposed by the Immigration Laws which were in force therein prior to
the coming into effect of Act 22 of 1913, but who, by reason of the
wording of Section 20 thereof, are not yet regarded as being
“domiciled” in the sense in which that term is defined in the Section in
question, shall, in the event of their absenting themselves temporarily
from the Province in which they are lawfully resident, be treated, on
their return, as if the term “domicile” as so defined did apply to them.

(6)

He will submit to the Minister of Justice the cases of those persons
who have in the past been convicted of “bona fide passive resistance
offences” (a term which is mutually understood) and that he anticipates
no objection on Mr. De Wet’s part to the suggestion that convictions
for such offences will not be used by the Government against such
persons in the future.

(7)

A document will be issued to every “specially exempted educated
entrant” who is passed by the Immigration Officers under the
instructions of the Minister issued under Section 25 of Act No. 22 of
1913,

(8)

All the recommendations of the Indian Grievances Commission
enumerated at the conclusion of their Report, which remain over and
above the points dealt with in the Indians’ Relief Bill, will be adopted
by the Government;

and subject to the stipulation contained in the last paragraph of this letter
the necessary further action in regard to those matters will be issued without
delay.
With regard to the administration of existing laws, the Minister desires me to
say that it always has been and will continue to be the desire of the Government to see
that they are administered in a just manner and with due regard to vested rights.
In conclusion, General Smuts desires me to say that it is, of course,
understood, and he wishes no doubts on the subject to remain, that the placing of the
Indians’ Relief Bill on the Statute Book of the Union, coupled with the fulfilment of
the assurances he is giving in this letter in regard to the other matters referred to
herein, touched upon at the recent interviews, will constitute a complete and final
settlementof the controversy which has unfortunately existed for so long, and will be

APPENDIX XVIII
(1) GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S DESPATCH TO COLONIAL OFFICE
CAPE TOWN ,

July 4, 1914
SIR,

The agreement reached between General Smuts and Mr. Gandhi upon outstanding administrative points, as reported to you by telegraph on the 1st instant, is a
welcome sequel to the enactment of the Indians’ Relief Bill, and presages, I trust, a
respite from those Indians’ troubles which have formed the subject of constant
correspondence during practically the whole of my residence in this country.
2. I enclose herewith copies of the two letters1 which were summarised in my
telegram. The concessions promised by the Minister display a spirit of generosity
and statesmanship. All Mr. Gandhi’s stipulations which were recorded in my Secret
Despatch of the 30th May have been met, although in regard to the preservation of
vested rights in the administration of existing laws and particularly of the Transvaal
Gold Law, the general assurance given towards the end of Mr. Gorges’ letter is less
precise and categorical than Mr. Gandhi desired. This point, I believe, was found the
most difficult of adjustment. On Sunday last General Smuts said that on the previous
day he had received Mr. Gandhi in an interview lasting a couple of hours, and that,
apart from the question of the administration of the Gold Law, an agreement was in
sight. Upon the Gold Law, however, Mr. Gandhi’s demands involved an extension
rather than a confirmation of vested rights as understood by the Minister, and he did
not think it would be possible to give the specific assurance for which he was asked.
Being anxious for a settlement, he was still considering what could be done, but he
doubted that he would be able to go as far as Mr. Gandhi wished. The further
negotiations were conducted by Mr. Gorges, and in the end Mr. Gandhi, either in a
mood of sweet reasonableness or from reluctanceto jeopardize what he had obtained
1
The reference is to E. M. Gorges’ letter to Gandhiji of June 30, 1914, the
preceding appendix, and Gandhiji’s reply thereto of the same date (“Letter to E. M.
Gorges”, 30-6-1914).

VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

499

for the sake of the unobtainable, signified his willingness to accept the formula
which was offered and to close the bargain. Letters were exchanged and on the
following morning, the 1st instant, Mr. Gandhi left Cape Town for Durban. My
Secretary, who happened to meet him before his departure, did not observe any
marked change in his appearance as the result of his recent fast. In the course of a
brief conversation he spoke with great modesty of his own share in the settlement
and with generosity of the help which had been given by others.
3. Mr. Gandhi presumably will publish the attached correspondence shortly
after the end of the session. It is not likely to enhance the popularity of the
Government in Nationalist circles, and even in some other quarters, especially in
Natal, it may be expected to have a dubious reception. In these circumstances
publicity before Parlia-ment has risen might prove very inconvenient. I need not lay
stress on the courage with which General Smuts has disregarded the prejudices of a
large section of his party.
4. The assurance given on the first point specified in Mr. Gorges’ letter
should go far to allay the apprehensions which have been aroused in Natal as to the
effect of the removal of the £3 licence. These misconceptions are responsible for the
foolish telegrams from Durban, which have been communicated to you under cover of
my Despatches No. 467 and No. 468 of the 2nd instant, asking that the Bill should be
“vetoed”. The sender of one of them, Mr. K. K. Pillay, who describes himself as
“Chairman of the £3 tax Committee”, is said to be a person of no importance. I am
also told that it is very doubtful whether Mr. M. C. Coovadia, from whom the other
emanates, has any considerable following even among the members of the Natal
Indian Congress. Information has reached me that at a recent so-called “mass
meeting” which he summoned the attendance only numbered some thirty Indians. For
the accuracy of this statement I cannot, however, vouch. There is some force in his
criticism of Section 7 of the Act as redrafted. The point had not been overlooked. I
saw the new clause for the first time when it appeared among the amendments on the
Order paper. I at once caused enquiry to be made why the Commission’s recommendation had been varied so that proof might be required not only of the
identity of the Indian producing a certificate of domicile, but also of the grantee’s
lawful title to its issue. I was advised that in some cases such certificates had been
obtained by fraud and that the Government did not think it right that these should be
protected. I should have preferred the original clause, but as the contention of the
Government was not in itself unreasonable, and as Mr. Gandhi took no exception to
the amendment, I did not feel called upon to cause embarrassment by insisting on so
relatively trivial a detail. In other respects Mr. Coovadia’s telegram is futile. It is
conceivable, though there is no evidence, that this agitation may have been
encouraged by a few Euro- peans in Natal who were perhaps not averse from allowing

500

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

Indian suspicion and credulity to be stimulated into a belief that, in the absence of a
£3 licence, reindenture was the only safeguard against compulsory repatriation. Mr.
Gandhi’s influence may, upon his return to Natal, be expected to supply the
necessary corrective.
5. On the second point in Mr. Gorges’ letter, the concession is more generous
even than the Commission’s recommendation in so far as the requirement that the
plural wives affected shall previously at some time have lived in South Africa has
been omitted. That the privilege was only to be granted if the number of potential
beneficiaries was found to be small has been common ground throughout.
6. On the third point Mr. Gandhi receives the desired administrative assurance
in regard to the question of the “Cape entry”. On the fourth point his difficulty about
the Orange Free State declaration is met. The matter dealt with in the fifth point had
not hitherto, so far as I am aware, been raised. It is disposed of in an eminently fair
and reasonable manner. On the sixth point a conciliatory and favourable answer is
given to Mr. Gandhi’s plea that past convictions for “bona fide passive resistance
offences” should not in future be brought up against the persons so convicted. The
seventh point regulates satisfactorily a detail of procedure in connection with the
admission of “specially exempted entrants”. In the eighth point the pledge given by
General Smuts in the House of Assembly as to the adoption of all the administrative
recommendations summarised at the end of the Commission’s report is explicitly
reiterated. No surprise can be felt at the addition of a stipulation that the fulfilment of
all these assurances in conjunction with the legislative action which has been taken
is subject to the understanding that the settlement will be accepted as complete and
final by the Indian community.
7. Mr. Gandhi in his reply says unequivocally that the passage of the Bill and
this correspondence bring the passive resistance struggle to a final close and at the
end of his letter he expresses his conviction that, if the generous spirit recently
displayed by the Government continues to be applied, as promised, in the
administration of existing laws, the Indian community in the Union will be able to
enjoy some measure of peace and will never be a source of trouble to the Government.
Further than this Mr. Gandhi could hardly be expected to go, and General Smuts would
probably have been glad if the letter had been confined to these two statements. The
indication that other points stand over for adjustment at some future date is, however,
tactfully worded, and Mr. Gandhi may have felt its inclusion to be necessary both in
justice to himself and as a means of preventing any immediate clamour for further
concessions. General Smuts, when the letter was submitted to him, is understood to
have described it as a remarkable feat of diplomacy and ingenuity; he does not appear
to have regarded it as a serious departure from the terms of settlement, but I have not
yet had an opportunity of sounding him personally on the point.

VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

8. I enclose two newspaper extracts. The first reports the proceedings at a
congratulatory function held in Mr. Gandhi’s honour on Saturday last. The speeches
delivered by Senator Marshall Campbell, Mr. Meyler, and Mr. Gandhi will be read
with interest. The second records a grumble by a Muhammdan Society at
Johannesburg. Their grievance presumably is that the Act fails to give recognition to
polygamy, and that grievance, I fear, will, for the present at any rate, have to remain
unredressed. The legislation of Mauritius, to which a Muhammadan deputation invited
the attention of General Smuts, is considered by the Department of the Interior, with
whose view I agree, to be rather less liberal, in this respect than the marriage
provisions of the Indians Relief Act as passed by the Union Parliament.

(2) GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S DESPATACH TO COLONIAL OFFICE
CAPE TOWN ,

July 10, 1914
SIR,

I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of correspondence, as
published in the Press, between the Department of the Interior and Mr. Gandhi upon
certain administrative questions which had stood over for adjustment pending the
enactment of the Indians’ Relief Bill. The Act which has now been placed on the
Statute Book gives effect to those recommendations of the Indian Enquiry Commission which necessitated legislation. The remaining recommendations were such as
could be dealt with departmentally. In regard to them the necessary action is promised
in the enclosed correspondence and this promise is supplemented by assurances
acceptable to Mr. Gandhi upon the other points which he had specified as essential to
the attainment of a satisfactory settlement.
2. Mr. Gandhi’s statement that this correspondence, coupled with the passage
of the Bill, finally closes the passive resistance struggle which began nearly eight
years ago will be noted with much gratification. I am glad indeed in relinquishing my
office here to know that the Indian troubles of South Africa which have occasioned so
much anxiety not only to the Government and people of this country but also to His
Majesty’s Government and the Government of India may now be expected to subside.
In my judgment the Ministers and Parliament of the Union a well as Sir William
Solomon and his fellow Commissioners have performed a great Imperial service by
their several contributions to the present settlement.
3. It will be observed that while Mr. Gandhi accepts the agreement so far as he
personally is concerned, he mentions in his letter a few other points which, in his

502

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

opinion, remain to be dealt with at some future date. He does not, however,
foreshadow a revival of agitation, and I cannot believe that any considerable portion
of the Indian community will be so ill-advised as to make the concessions which
have been afforded to them a new starting point for further demands. Some
apprehensions in this respect seem to have been felt by the writer of a leading article
in the Cape Argus, of which I attach a copy, but it is to be hoped that the Indians,
after obtaining so much, will not commit the folly of displaying impatience because
they have not obtained even more.
4. The further Press extracts which are enclosed will be read with interest.
The first reproduces the text of two telegrams despatched from Johannesburg
to Mr. Gokhale in England and to some addressee at Bombay, respectively. The
former is signed by Mr. Cachalia, whose ultimatum to the Government, it will be
remembered, formed the prelude of the Natal Strike and its concomitant movements
towards the end of last year; the latter is signed by Messrs Cachalia, Gandhi,
Kallenbach, and Polak. In both the words “final settlement” are used, and both are
conceived in a spirit and couched in language to which the most querulous critic could
take no exception.
The second extract reports Mr. Gandhi’s arrival at Durban and the adoption of a
Resolution by the Natal Indian Association approving of his action.
The third summarises a farewell speech delivered by Mr. Gandhi at a reception
given in the Town Hall of Durban under the presidency of the Mayor, on the 8th
instant. You will observe that he expresses gratitude to the Union Government,
acknowledges the help received from other quarters, and in speaking of the
settlement appears to attach no qualifications to them.
The circumstance that he proposes to leave South Africa next week may
perhaps be taken as implying that he regards his labours in this country as having
been brought to an honourable conclusion.
I have, etc.,

and troubles tried them.—Quran
To survey, within a limited space, the origins and incidents of a movement
that has occupied eight years of the history of South African Indians is a task
impossible of satisfactory fulfilment. The present sketch will, therefore, be but a
hasty outline, with here and there an indicator emphasising a noteworthy occurrence
or a fundamental outline.
The origins of the Passive Resistance Struggle are to be sought, not in the
agitation of 1906, but in that which commenced, in one of its phases, in the
Transvaal, in 1885, and, in another, in Natal, in 1894. The old Republican Law 3 of
1885, whilst imposing various burdens upon Asiatics residing in the country,
required that such of them as entered for purposes of trade should be registered at a
fixed fee, and that, “for sanitary purposes”, they should reside in Locations specially
set apart for them. To a large extent, both requirements proved a dead letter, but a
great deal of friction with the British Government was engendered, resulting in
Imperial intervention at the time of the War, when resident Indians, as British
subjects, were promised complete redress of their grievances.
In Natal, a British Colony, the position had been complicated by the grave
prejudice aroused by the presence of large numbers of Indian labourers brought at the
instance of the European Colonists under indenture, and an agitation had arisen for
the exclusion of free Asiatic immigration and the disfranchisement of all Asiatics. It
became a question whether this was to be accomplished by specifically racial
legislation or by general enactment differentially administered. The conflict of views
represented by these two methods raged for some time, but at last, thanks to the
statesmanship of Mr. Chamberlain, in 1897, the second method was adopted, and the
famous “Natal Act” passed, imposing an educational and not a racial test. From then
onwards, in Natal, racial legislation was a thing of the past, and hence the first signs
of renewed trouble arose in the Transvaal, where the principle of statutory equality
had not been accepted, owing to a different political conception of the status of
Coloured people.
In the re-settlement that took place after the War, it was hoped that the burdens
would be removed from the shoulders of the British Indian community, but Indians
were dismayed to find the Imperial authorities endeavouring vigorously to enforce the
obnoxious legislation against which they had strongly protested in pre-War days, a
policy that was later weakly defended by Lord Selborne. Immigration of Indians was
severely restricted by the Peace Preservation Ordinance. Registration of practically
all adult male Indians, under Law 3 of 1885, was urged by Lord Milner, and was
subsequently agreed to by the Indian leaders as a purely voluntary act, on Lord

504

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

Milner’s definite promise1 that this registration would be regarded as complete and
final, and that the certificates issued would constitute a permanent right of residence
to the holders and a right to come and go at will.
Meanwhile, Law 3 of 1885 was being enforced so as to compel all Indians to
reside and trade in Locations, and the pre-War controversy was revived, resulting in
an appeal to the Supreme Court, which reversed the old Republican High Court’s
decision, and held that Indians were free to trade anywhere they pleased, and that
non-residence in a Location was not punishable at law. This decision was a severe
rebuff to the anti-Indian element in the European population that had its
representatives even in the Government, which endeavoured to legislate to overcome
the effect of the Supreme Court decision—without result, however, owing to the
intervention of the then Secretary of State for the Colonies, the late Mr. Lyttelton.
But the general public, by ingeniously manipulated statistics, were led to believe in a
huge influx of unauthorised Asiatics into the Transvaal, to which some colour was
lent by the dispersal of the Indian residents of the Johannesburg Indian Location
throughout the Colony, after it was burnt down at the time of the plague outbreak in
1904, and meetings all over the Transvaal were held with the object of closing the
door against all Asiatic immigration, and compelling Indians to trade and reside
exclusively in Locations. In an atmosphere of prejudice and terror thus created, it was
impossible effectively to protest one’s innocence, and the request of the Indian
community for an open and impartial inquiry, whether by Royal Commission or
otherwise, fell on deaf ears; so that when a draft ordinance was published in 1906 to
“amend” Law 3 of 1885, requiring compulsory re-registration of the entire Indian
community, men, women, and children, it was vociferously welcomed by the whole
European population, whilst it fell amongst the Indian victims-to-be like a
bombshell. The basic assumption, on the part of the authorities, for its necessity lay
in the unquenchable belief in wholesale Indian immigration of an unlawful character,
to which, in their opinion, resident Indians could not but be a party. So far as the
general public was concerned, the measure was hailed as the first instalment of a
scheme designed to drive Indians out of the Colony altogether, and Europeans in the
neighbouring Colonies and territories eagerly looked on, as they had looked on, in
1903, at Lord Milner’s abortive effort to compel Indian trade and residence in
Locations, so that they might take advantage of the results of the new policy to
relieve themselves of their own Asiatic “incubus”.
Appalled by the magnitude of the disaster that threatened the community, the
Indian leaders hastened to take steps to avoid it, if possible. They sought an
interview with the responsible member of the Government, but succeeded only in
getting women excluded from the operation of the measure, and, as a last resort, an
Indian mass meeting 2 was held at the moment that the legislative Council was

debating the clauses of the draft ordinance. Whilst the Council’s debate was
perfunctory and prearranged performance, the whole business being concluded in less
than a couple of hours, the crowded Empire Theatre rang with impassioned
denunciations of the Government’s policy, which belied the solemn undertaking of
Lord Milner in every important respect, assumed the guilt of the Indian community
unheard and without proof, and adumbrated their virtual expulsion from the Colony,
and, eventually, from South Africa. So fierce was the indignation aroused that, when
the famous Fourth Resolution 1 was put, committing all present, and those they
represented, to go to gaol, if the measure should become law, until such time as it
should be repealed or disallowed, the whole vast audience of three thousand persons
rose as one man, and shouted a solemn “Amen,” when the oath of Passive Resistance
was administered. Simultaneously, however, and as a last effort to avoid a terrible
conflict, a deputation to England was arranged for.2 The delegates proceeded there to
interview the Imperial authorities and arouse public opinion, and their efforts resulted
in the suspension of the Royal Assent to the measure owing to the imminence of the
inauguration of self-government in the Transvaal, and in the formation of the famous
South Africa British Indian Committee, with Sir Mancherji Bhownaggree as its
Executive Chairman, Mr. L. W. Ritch as its Secretary, and, subsequently, Lord
Ampthill as its President.
The disallowance of the measure was, however, merely a temporary respite,
for, taking umbrage at what was thought to be an impertinent intrusion on the part of
the Imperial Government in the affairs of a practically self-governing British
Colony, the European section of the population angrily demanded the immediate
re-enactment of the ordinance, and almost the first action of the new Parliament was
to rush it through all its stages in a single session of a unanimous House, 3 entirely
ignoring Indian opinion and Indian protests, for, as Indians were not directly
represented in Parliament, nobody appeared to consider it necessary to take their
feelings into consideration.
Still anxious to avoid a struggle that had appeared to be inevitable, the Indian
leaders had urged the Government and Parliament not to proceed with the Bill, but to
accept a voluntary effort of re-registration in a manner that might be mutually agreed
upon, in which they proffered all possible assistance. But they were distrusted and
ignored, and all the tragic possibilities of a prolonged conflict were forced upon the
Indian community. In July 1907, the new Act came into force, and registration under
it officially commenced, in compartments, the registration officers travelling from
town to town throughout the Colony. Their efforts to induce registration were wholly
unsuccessful, and an extension of the advertised time for registration was given by

the Government, as a last opportunity to comply with the law. But 95 per cent of the
Indian community remained true to its oath. Meanwhile, a further effort had been made
to avoid an extension of the trouble, and a petition1 , signed by some 3,000 Indians,
had been addressed to the Government, imploring them to realise the depth of
suffering into which it was threatened to plunge the Indian community, who once
more offered voluntary re-registration if the Act was suspended. The petition was
rejected contemptuously, and, at the end of the year, several of the leaders were
arrested, ordered to leave the Colony, and, upon their refusal to do so, imprisoned for
various periods. This process was repeated, until some hundreds of all classes were
lodged in gaol, and the Government, realising that their efforts to crush the
communtiy had failed, opened up negotiations through the agency of Mr. Albert
Cartwright, then Editor of The Transvaal Leader, with the result that, almost at the
moment that H. H. the Aga Khan was presiding over a huge public meeting of protest
in Bombay, a compromise was signed, whereby it was agreed to suspend passive
resistance, to proceed with voluntary re-registration for a period of three months,
during which the operation of the law was to be suspended, and, as the Indian
signatories clearly understood, to repeal the hated Act if the re-registration was
satisfactorily completed. In the meantime, the situation had been complicated by the
passing of an Immigration Act that, operating jointly with the Asiatic Law
Amendment Act, absolutely prohibited all Asiatic immigration, no matter how
cultured the immigrant might be. Thus, at a stroke, the policy of non-racial
legislation, that had been so strongly advocated by Mr. Chamberlain, was destroyed.
The community, however, realised that, with the repeal of the Asiatic Act, the racial
taint would disappear, and all efforts were, accordingly, concentrated upon that. The
commencement of voluntary re-registration was signalised by a murderous attack
upon Mr. Gandhi2 by a misguided countryman, and, for the moment, everything was
in confusion. But a special appeal to the community was made and, with confidence
restored and the promise of repeal, re-registration was duly completed by the middle
of May, and Lord Selborne himself bore testimony to its satisfactoriness. Then the
Government were called upon to perform their part of the compromise, but the
promise of repeal was repudiated, and immediately the Indian community was thrown
into a turmoil. The Government offered to repeal the Act provided that certain classes
of Indians were treated as prohibited immigrants, and the racial bar remained in the
Immigration Law. Naturally, these terms were indignantly rejected, and the
community prepared for a revival of Passive Resistance. Mr. Sorabji Shapurji, an
educated Parsee from Natal, was Imprisoned as a protest against the racial bar. The
Natal Indian leaders entered the Transvaal, in order to cooperate with their brethren

there, and were arrested as prohibited immigrants and ordered to leave the Colony. But
at a mass meeting 1 held in Johannesburg, at which they were present, hundreds of
certificates of voluntary registration were publicly burnt, and a challenge of
wholesale imprisonment was thrown out to the Government, who took alarm at the
situation, and a conference of leading members of the Government and Opposition,
and of representatives of the Indian and Chinese communities, together with Mr.
Albert Cartwright, as mediator, was held at Pretoria. The conference proved abortive,
however, for though they were prepared to waive the other points upon which they
had previously insisted, the Government proved adamant on the two main issues.
They definitely refused either to repeal the Asiatic Act or to remove the racial bar of
the Immigration Law. An amending Bill was passed through both Houses of
Parliament, validating voluntary registration, and improving the Indian position in
certain respects, but it being, in the main, unsatisfactory for the reasons given
above, it was not recognized by the Passive Resisters, who resumed the struggle with
energy. The new measure, however, strengthened the hands of the Government by
giving them powers of deportation, which, however, were at first neutralised by their
deporting Passive Resisters across the Natal border, whence they returned as fast as
they were deported.
Into the many details and ramifications of the struggle at this stage it is
unnecessary now to enter; suffice it to recall the Delagoa Bay incidents, when the
Portuguese Government acted as the catspaw of the Transvaal, in preventing the entry
into the Transvaal of returning Indians lawfully resident there, the various test-cases
brought in the Supreme Court against the Government, some of which were lost and
some won, the voluntary insolvency of Mr. A. M. Cachalia, the Chairman of the
British Indian Association, who preferred to keep his oath and preserve his honour to
the sordid joy of money-making, the imprisonment of Indians of all classes by
hundreds, the appeals to India, where protest meetings were held in different parts of
the country, the financial help of Natal, the arousing of enthusiasm amongst Indians
all over the country, the activity of Lord Ampthill’s Committee in London, and of the
British Press, the bitter controversies that raged in the Transvaal papers, the latent
sympathy of not a few Transvaal Europeans, culminating in the formation of Mr.
Hos- ken’s Committee that rendered such splendid and patriotic service in a number of
ways, the public letter to The Times, the refusal of the Royal Assent to anti Indian
measures passed by the Legislatures of Natal and Southern Rhodesia, the Indian mass
meetings in Johannesburg and all over South Africa, the weakening of some sections
of the Indian community and the strengthening of others, the amazing revelation of
Tamil strength and fortitude, the energetic labours of the Indian women, the ruin and
desolation of businesses and homes, the cruel gaol hardships whose purpose was to

crush the spirit of the Passive Resisters, the magnificent courage of those who sought
imprisonment again and again, the glorious religious spirit that was developed as the
struggle moved on from phase to phase, the hopes and fears, the firm faith of the
leaders in ultimate success—all these constitute a pageant of incidents and emotions
that gave greatness to the Passive Resistance movement, and that bestowed upon its
most distinguishing characteristics.
New life was given to the movement in the middle of 1909, when two
deputationswere authorised to proceed to England and India respectively, to cultivate
public opinion there and to seek assistance. As the delegates were on the point of
leaving, the majority of them were arrested and imprisoned as passive resisters,
doubtless with the intention of preventing the departure of the remainder. But the
community insisted that the deputations should go. In England, interest in the
question was strongly revived, and, as Transvaal Ministers were there at the time in
connection with the Draft Act of Union, the Imperial authorities strove to effect a
settlement; but General Smuts proved obdurate, and flatly declined to remove the
statutory racial bar and substitute for it general legislation, though it was clear that
the Asiatic Act was doomed. The deputation, which had been led by Mr. Gandhi,
therefore returned to South Africa, having accomplished only a part of what it had
hoped to achieve, but having arranged for a body of volunteers who undertook to
collect funds and keep the subject before the public.
The deputation to India, heralded by the tragic death of Nagappen shortly after
his release from prison, was of a different character. Mr. Polak, who was the sole
remaining delegate, placed himself unreservedly in the hands of the Hon. Mr.
Gokhale, whose Servants of India Society arranged for meetings to be held in every
part of the country, from Bombay to Rangoon, from Madras to Lahore. Tremendous
enthusiasm was aroused, Indian patriotic pride in the sufferers in South Africa was
awakened, and funds were energetically collected following the example of Mr. Ratan
J. Tata, some £10,000 being contributed for the maintenance of the struggle, ruling
princes sending generous subscriptions. All sections of the people united in
demanding the intervention of the Imperial Government, and at the historic session
of the Imperial Council at Calcutta, the Government of India announced its acceptance
of Mr. Gokhale’s resolution, unanimously supported, to take powers to prohibit the
further recruitment of indentured labour in India for Natal. After a thirteen months’
campaign, India had been educated on the South African Indian question to a degree
that aroused the attention and anxiety of the Home authorities, and when angry
protests came from every part of the country against the Transvaal Government’s
action in deporting to India large numbers of Passive Resisters (many of them born in
South Africa), with the object of breaking up the movement, the Imperial
Government, upon the urgent representations of the Government of India,

VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

509

successfully implored the Transvaal—and, subsequently, the Union—Administration
to cease to deport. The deportees subsequently returned to South Africa, but with the
loss of Narayansamy, who died at Delagoa Bay after having been unlawfully denied a
landing anywhere in British territory.
Meanwhile, the four South African Colonies had become Provinces of the
Union of South Africa, and the Imperial Government, convinced at last of the justice
of the Indian cause, and taking advantage of the possibilities of the new situation,
addressed to the Union Government the memorable despatch of October 7, 1910, in
which they powerfully recommended the repeal of Act 2 of 1907, the removal of the
racial bar, and the substitution for the latter of the Indian suggestion of non-racial
legislation modified by administrative differentiation, effectively limiting future
Indian immigration to a minimum number annually of highly educated men, whose
services would be required for the higher needs of the Indian community. To this
dispatch was appended the condition that nothing that was done to Settle the
Transvaal controversy at the expense of the Indians residing in the Coast Provinces
would be satisfactory to the Imperial Government. The Union Ministers responded in
a friendly manner, the struggle became less acute, and ultimately, in 1911, a Union
Immigration Bill was published, purporting to settle the controversy that had been
raging for so long. The new measure, however, obviously did not serve its purpose,
for, whilst repealing the Asiatic Act of 1907, saving the rights of minors that had
been declared by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Chotabhai case,
the Bill did not remove the racial bar, but rather extended it throughout the Union, by
reason of the Orange Free State entry question, and it took away other rights not only
from Transvaal Indians, but from those resident in the Coast Provinces. A unanimous
outcry arose from them, negotiations were re-opened, and the suggestion was thrown
out by the Passive Resistance leaders that the Bill should be replaced by one limited
to the Transvaal alone, which, however, was not adopted. Eventually it was found
impossible to pass the Bill, and a provisional settlement was arranged, whereby the
Indians undertook to suspend Passive Resistance, whilst the Government promised to
introduce satisfactory legislation in the 1912 session of Parliament, meanwhile
administering the law as though it had already been altered, and specially exempting,
in terms of an earlier understanding, a limited number of educated entrants into the
Transvaal.
Taking advantage of the full, and of the better feeling aroused at the time of the
King’s Coronation in India, a further mission was sent there, in order to maintain
public interest and to place before the Government the points upon which the Indian
community insisted. The measure of 1912, however, met with no better fate than its
predecessor, and the provisional agreement was extended for another year. It was then
that preparations were made throughout South Africa to welcome the Hon. Mr.

510

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

Gokhale, whose tour in the subcontinent is still fresh in the minds of all. He
succeeded, as no one else had yet done, in raising the discussion of the Indian
problem to the Imperial plane, and won the admiration even of his opponents for his
moderation and statesmanship. It was during this visit that Indians later alleged, on
his authority, that a promise of repeal of the iniquitous £3 tax was made by the
Government, in view of the fact that, for over a year, further indentured immigration
from India had been prohibited by the Indian Government.
When the 1913 Bill, however, was introduced into Parliament, and the Indian
leaders observed the spirit in which the Indian question was dealt with by the Union
Ministers, grave fears were aroused that a situation, which had already become still
further complicated by the position created by the Searle judgment, invalidating
practically every Indian marriage, would once more develop into a catastrophe. The
Government were warned that the marriage question must be settled if peace were
desired, and that the racial bar must be finally removed from the measure.
Amendments were introduced and accepted by the Government, purporting to settle
the marriage controversy on the basis of the recognition of de facto monogamous
marriages, but, even as passed, the Bill failed to satisfy the demands of the Passive
Resisters, whilst the £3 tax remained unrepealed. A final attempt was made by the
Indian leaders to avoid a revival of the struggle, and negotiations were once more
opened with the Government, so as to obtain a promise of remedial legislation in the
next session of Parliament. They were, however, interrupted by the European strike,
during the heat of which Mr. Gandhi, as spokesman of the Passive Resisters,
undertook to refrain from pressing the Indian case for the moment. Meanwhile, a
mission had proceeded to England to co-operate with the Hon. Mr. Gokhale, at his
urgent invitation, in order to bring home to the imperial Government and the British
public the extreme gravity of the situation, and the certainty of the extension of the
demands of Passive Resisters unless a settlement of the points in dispute were
promptly arrived at. All these representations, however, failed to conciliate the
Union Government, which proved obdurate, and a final warning was sent to them
stating that unless assurances of the introduction of legislative and administrative
measures, in the following session, were given to recognize in law the validity of de
facto monogamous marriages to remove the racial bar, as regards the Free State, to
restore the right of entry into the Cape Colony to South Africa-born Indians, to
repeal the £3 tax, and to administer justly and with due regard to vested interests
existing legislation operating harshly against Indians, Passive Resistance would be
immediately revived. The warning was ignored, and the struggle was resumed in all its
bitterness and on a much wider scale than before. Its incidents are too fresh in the
public mind to need more than a brief mention—the campaign of the Indian women
whose marriages had been dishonoured by a fresh decision of the Supreme Court, at
the instigation of the Government, the awakening of the free and indentured labourers
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

511

all over Natal, the tremendous strikes, the wonderful and historic strikers’ march of
protest into the Transvaal, the horrible scenes enacted later in the effort to crush the
strikers and compel them to resume work, the arrest and imprisonment of the
principal leaders and of hundreds—almost thousands—of the rank and file, the
enormous Indian mass meetings held in Durban, Johannesburg, and other parts of the
Union, the fierce and passionate indignation aroused in India, the large sums of
money poured into South Africa from all parts of the Motherland, Lord Hardinge’s
famous speech at Madras, in which he placed himself at the head of Indian public
opinion, and his demand for a Commission of Inquiry, the energetic efforts of Lord
Ampthill’s Committee, the hurried intervention of the Imperial authorities, the
appointment over the heads of the Indian community of a Commission whose
personnel could not satisfy the Indians, the discharge of the leaders whose advice to
ignore the Commission was almost entirely accepted, the arrival of Messrs Andrews
and Pearson and their wonderful work of reconciliation, the deaths of Hurbatsingh
and Valliamma, the strained position relieved only by the interruption of the second
European strike, when Mr. Gandhi once more undertook not to hamper the
Government whilst they had their hands full with the fresh difficulty, and, when it
had been dealt with, the entirely new spirit of friendliness, trust, and co-operation
that was found to have been created by the moderation of the great Indian leader and
the loving influence spread around him by Mr. Andrews as he proceeded with his
great Imperial mission.
All these things are of recent history, as are the favourable recommendations
of the Commission on practically every point referred to it and out of which Passive
Resistance had arisen, the adoption of the Commission’s Report in its entirety by
the Government, the introduction and passing into law of the Indians’ Relief Act,
after lengthy and remarkable debates in both Houses of the Legislature, the
correspondence between Mr. Gandhi and General Smuts, in which the latter
undertook, on behalf of the Government, to carry through the administrative reforms
that were not covered by the new Act, and the Indian protagonist of Passive
Resistance formally announced the conclusion of the struggle and set forth the
points upon which Indians would sooner or later have to be satisfied before they could
acquire complete equality of civil status—and the final scenes of departure, enacted
throughout the country, wherein the deaths and sufferings of the Indian martyrs,
Nagappen, Narayansamy, Hurbatsingh, and Valliamma, were justified and sanctified
to the world.
It is significant that, as Passive Resistance became stronger and purer, it
succeeded more and more in bringing together the best representatives of the
European and Indian sections of the population. With each new phase came new
triumphs and new friends. Whilst every material gain has been but the restoration of

512

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

that which was taken away, each gain of principle has been the concession of that
which had been denied. The struggle commenced with a protest against the universal
distrust and contempt for the Indian community. That distrust and contempt have been
exchanged for trust and respect. It commenced with the complete ignoring of Indian
sentiment. Gradually that policy, too, was altered, save that it revived acutely when
the Commission was appointed over the heads of those mainly interested in its
findings. To-day, however, the leaders are consulted in matters vitally affecting the
welfare of the Indian community, and Passive Resistance has given for these
disfranchised ones far more than the vote could have won, and in a shorter time. The
movement commenced with a demand for the repeal of the Transvaal Act 2 of 1907.
The Act was repealed and its threatened extension to other parts of South Africa was
completely prevented. At the beginning, racial legislation against Indians was
threatened, so as to drive them from the Colony. The Settlement has removed the
possibility of racial legislation against Indians throughout the Empire. The system
of indentured immigration from India, that had been regarded almost as a permanent
feature of South African economics, has been ended. The hated £3 tax has been
repealed and its attendant misery and insult destroyed. Vested rights, that were
tending everywhere to disappear, are to be maintained and protected. The bulk of
Indian marriages, that had never previously received the sanction of South African
law, are henceforth to be fully recognized in law. But above and beyond all this is the
new spirit of conciliation that has resulted from the hardships, the sufferings, the
sacrifices of the Passive Resisters. The flag of legal racial equality has been kept
flying, and it is now recognized that Indians have rights and aspirations and ideals
that cannot be ignored. The struggle has more than proved the immense superiority of
right over might, of soul-force over brute-force, of love and reason over hate and
passion. India has been raised in the scale of nations, her children in South Africa
have been ennobled, and the way is now open to them to develop their capacities in
peace and concord, and thus contribute their quota to the building up of this great new
nation that is arising in the South African sub-continent.

APPENDIX XX
LETTER FROM C. ROBERTS
[After August 14, 1914]
DEAR MR. GANDHI,

Lord Crewe desires me to thank you for your letter of the 14th, and to express
his warm recognition of your loyal offer of services.
His Lordship desires to accept the offer in the spirit in which it has been made,
VOL. 14 : 26 DECEMBER, 1913 - 20 MAY, 1915

513

and he has given his earnest consideration to the manner in which the services of the
Indian community can be utilised to the best interest of the Empire.
He is disposed to think that it would not be advisable for Indian student to
volunteer for military duties. If they enlist in the force which Lord Kitchener is
now raising, they may not be able to leave it for three years’ time. His Lordship
is very averse to encouraging them without the sanction of their parents to take
a step which would so seriously interrupt the purpose for which they came to this
country, and which might prejudice their whole future. Neither is it possible to advise
them to join the Territorial Force, as the establishment is now complete, and a long
waiting list is already in existence, so that at the present it is impossible to secure
enrolment in that force.
There is, however, another sphere of public duty not less important for which
in this country we are in the habit of depending very largely upon voluntary
assistance, and this consists in rendering aid to the sick and wounded. The number of
these in the present war may, unhappily, be large, and if that should prove to be the
case, the military hospitals and military staff may have difficulty in coping with the
demands made upon them. It will, therefore, be necessary to create temporary and
voluntary organisations to meet this emergency. This duty is already being
undertaken by a very large number of Englishmen and women in the voluntary aid
detachments of the British Red Cross Society, and it is to work of this kind that Lord
Crewe would direct your attention.
His Lordship suggests that a committee should be formed among the Indian
residents and visitors in London, and that they should undertake to get up an Indian
voluntary aid contingent. It is understood that Mr. James Cantlie, who has taken an
active part in the organisation of the voluntary aid detachments of the Red Cross
Society, has offered to train and drill an Indian voluntary aid contingent if a
sufficient number of persons are prepared to undergo a course of instruction. Lord
Crewe notices that several of the signatories to your letter are qualified medical men,
and if they will co-operate with Mr. Cantlie, there is reason to hope that the Indian
voluntary aid contingent would become one of the most efficient detachments in the
kingdom.
It is, of course, quite impossible at the present moment to guarantee that the
services of the Indian voluntary aid contingent will be utilised in any given direction.
If the number of sick and wounded should, fortunately, not be large, the ordinary
military and charitable hospitals will be able to deal with them. But the prevalent
feeling in this country, which, as your letter shows, is shared by Indians, is that we
ought all to prepare ourselves to render efficient service to the empire should the
necessity arise.
Yours truly,
CHARLES ROBERTS
